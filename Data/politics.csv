Curious Canadian here.,5,jdranb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/jdranb/curious_canadian_here/,5,1603094576.0,"Hi! Thanks for your time. As fairly recent follower of America politics (just got a job in Canada for an American company) I'd like to ask this sub for some info, and hopefully you all can help me out. All of my questions are geared toward what makes a Republican a Republican. To that end, I'd like to ask about your values. Please be specific if possible, for example, ""Freedom of Speech"" is a value, but ""Freedom"" would be a bit too generic for what I'm looking for.

1) What are unique core republican values, ranked in order of importance? Unique as in they are qualities the majority of Republicans desire their government to possess while a majority of Democrats wouldn't, or at least not as much.

2) What do you believe are core American values? Beliefs that, in your experience, Republicans and Democrats both agree upon? 

3) Lastly, what do you believe are unique Democrat values? Traits that a majority of Democrats desire in/from their government that a majority of Republicans would not.

Looking for a fair and objective response. Thanks in advance!

For those of you who may not know who Rooster Teeth are, they‚Äôre a media company that makes online content about video games, anime, live action shorts, etc. They‚Äôve been around for nearly 20 years, but this past year has been hell for them. They claim to be a very accepting and loving company of all values and genders and all that good stuff, which is cool. They‚Äôre all about equality and constant virtue signaling, but it‚Äôs all for show. A former employee, who is a black woman, came out a couple months ago explaining that the company treated her very poorly, like the ‚Äútoken black girl‚Äù essentially. Inappropriate race jokes and pretending to care about her made up a great portion of the reason as to why she left. And of course, all the employees acted all innocent and ‚Äúshould‚Äôve spoke up sooner‚Äù, yeah, ok, like y‚Äôall totally care now that y‚Äôall got called out on y‚Äôall hypocritical BS. Another founding employee got very quietly let go for condemning the riots in the streets in the wake of the George Floyd incident a few months back. Other prominent employees got let go in massive layoffs, and the final nail in the coffin, two of their employees (married employees, I might add) were sleeping with fans right under their noses. This dumpster fire of a a company is another shining example of how virtue signaling and pretending to care about race issues, sexual assault, and various other causes while letting it happen in your own workplace anyway causes you to ‚ÄúGet Woke, Go Broke.‚Äù RIP Rooster Teeth",hot,Republican

The in-person and online attacks against ACB this week really disturbed me, and I wanted to take some time to examine why I found them so foul.

I linked to an article that documented attacks on Twitter on ACB. Note that the most sexist and demeaning comments were made by other women. ‚ÄúClown car vagina.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLooking forward to seeing her casserole recipes,‚Äù etc. 

These women could not attack ACB on her legal credentials. They had to boil her down to her genitalia and make her a traitor to her sex because they couldn‚Äôt imagine a reality in which a woman may hold conservative ideals. 

I always try to assume best intentions, and looking back (I am middle-aged) I feel I have only experienced true sexism from a man twice.  Neither incident was major and I handled both on my own. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt happen, I am saying that I haven‚Äôt experienced it.

The only long lasting, brutal bullying I have ever experienced has been from other women, and it was due to the same reason Twitter doofs were going after ACB.  I fail to conform. If I disagree or have my own mind, I say so, and I‚Äôm frank about it but not an asshole. 

Even if it‚Äôs something minor, especially in the professional setting, many women view this as aggression and move to single out the offender. 

One could opine for days why this happens, but I think it‚Äôs critical to note that radical feminism ENCOURAGES this to happen. 

The culture that encourages unbelievers to be singled out and attacked is the number one reason I can‚Äôt hang with feminism, which means I also can‚Äôt hang with the leadership at my church, which has shifted radically liberal. My job has an overwhelmingly liberal tilt (education) so I cannot speak freely there, either. 

In all of these arenas, if I am singled out, it has been unilaterally by other women. So, on an emotional level, I really felt for ACB, as I‚Äôve had similar experiences on a less bombastic scale.",hot,Republican

2020 Made Me a Conservative For Life,21,jcbx82,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/jcbx82/2020_made_me_a_conservative_for_life/,4,1602891053.0,"In 2020, I began paying attention to politics and I learned that the Democratic party is the party of lockdowns, riots, and unchecked lies. I started paying attention when the democratic governor of my rural state locked down and closed schools, in a clear push to make a name for herself. Then democrats refused to denounce violent riots, and worse, let these fester by not cracking down on them or prosecuting criminals.  

I didn't vote in 2016, mainly because Trump was incoherent, and lacked decorum. I was caught up in starting a family, and climbing the ladder at work. Now, after three years of prosperity, being a homeowner, a parent, and starting to accumulate some actual money, I can't fathom voting for a democrat in the 2020 election, even though they seem poised to take the Senate and maintain the House. Even if this happens, I think the future of the Republican Party is bright. I look at young, articulate conservatives like Ben Sasse, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, and contrast that to The Squad, and I have hope. I look at an emboldened Ted Cruz, and have hope. I also look at conservatives that are influencers like Candace Owens, and Ben Shapiro and I have hope. 

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest, because I can't hardly share my newfound conservatism in the public sphere without retaliation. Who else are the beacons of a bright conservative future?",hot,Republican
The left has pushed me to the right.,280,jc10a0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/jc10a0/the_left_has_pushed_me_to_the_right/,72,1602842190.0,"So normally I don‚Äôt really support either political party and I think both have done things that are bad but what I‚Äôve been noticing about liberals is worrying, and it‚Äôs definitely convinced me who I should vote for, because even though in principle I agree more with the liberal political party, they seem so insane right now it‚Äôs crazy.


For instance, everyone knows about the KKK, and even though they are considered to be more of a conservative party, no one likes them, INCLUDING conservatives, obviously because they‚Äôre bigots who kill black people.


And yet, with liberals around these particular elections they seem to only think of violence and murder. I see plenty of videos of people sobbing because of the rioters and looters destroying their businesses. And BLM has also caused a lot of murder, and yet not only do liberals condone this behavior, they actively ENCOURAGE people to be violent and burn down buildings just to make a point, which is awful.


And also liberals claim to be the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù party, and yet the people in their party are just as racist,sexist, and bullying as any I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm honestly convinced most politicians are two cheeks of the same ass, because I‚Äôve seen the videos,photos,tweets,etc, of plenty of liberal politicians saying and doing racist things/rude things and also some who have had bad allegations against them, for instance:


Biden: ‚Äú If you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù


Cardi B drugged and robbed men


Billie Eilish said racial slurs against Asians


Chrissy Teigen supposedly bullied a teenager


Justin Trudeau wore blackface


Elizabeth Warren has been accused of treating women of color like crap and many have left her campaign. 


And I‚Äôm sure there are more but I think I‚Äôve made my point. They pander so much and it‚Äôs disgusting because you can tell most just say these things to get votes from unassuming people.",hot,Republican
Kamala's Husbands law firm actively protects Terrorism by Dictators.

The story is actively being attempted to be taken down so make sure to screen shot and download. 

Can't believe no one is covering this. 

DLA Piper and BGR Group are representing a county that is currently employing ISIS Jihadi fighters in a war zone against a small Christian county (Armenia) where there is evidence of war crimes being committed by Kamala's husbands firms client. There was a video of Azerbaijan fighters beheading their enemies. Yes these are the same ISIS fighters killing our Troop abroad and spreading terror in the world. They are buying influence.

DLA Piper's job is to make Azerbeijan look democratic and free with PR efforts in the USA with think tanks and influencing important politicians.  

Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo just put a end to their use of think tanks to add in their effort. 

https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/13/trump-think-tanks-foreign-funding-429209

Azerbaijan ranks last in the world in freedom of Press. No freedom of speech. The Vice President of the county is the current presidents wife who he appointed. The last President was his father.  WTF?  In US media, due to DLA Piper efforts they are portrayed as a Free and Democratic country, but in reality this is another North Korea. Seriously look for yourself.

Story Time: How a Facebook comment thread about Latinos outed a racist Leftist and gained me a new friend.,11,jccr1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/jccr1f/story_time_how_a_facebook_comment_thread_about/,3,1602893609.0,"So there was a comment thread under a post about ‚ÄúLatinx‚Äù icons, you know, that new buzzword that white woke people came up with to undermine Latino culture? So the top comment was a Latino man stating simply ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Latinx, it‚Äôs Latino‚Äù, which received dozens of likes fairly quickly. So I responded, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so weird how Latino people and culture have no problem with the word Latino but woke white people gotta butt in and act like they know what‚Äôs best for a community.‚Äù I received quite a few likes from various Latino people, and a few replies saying that ‚ÄúFinally, someone gets it‚Äù. But of course, a couple woke white women had to butt in and proceeded to explain to a bunch of ACTUAL Latinos that ‚ÄúLatinx‚Äù is actually the correct term and those Latinos were wrong. The backlash was glorious, the Latinos absolutely destroyed those women, and those women showed their true racist colors. I ended up DMing the original commenter and we got to talking and apparently he will be voting Trump and the Latino community sees this a lot from woke white people, this very talking down to attitude and treatment as if they are stupid. He voted for Obama but had an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment a few years ago and kinda realized this whole victim mentality and ‚Äúwhite savior‚Äù BS was stupid. He thanked me for actually respecting Latino culture and standing up with them against the woke mob. It made me feel pretty good.",hot,Republican

Liberal treatment of ACB is shocking- A liberal perspective,15,jbf6xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/jbf6xr/liberal_treatment_of_acb_is_shocking_a_liberal/,6,1602758106.0,"I had a few thoughts that I am not even sure the left is ready to hear. So I am posting them here. 

It is clear that Judge Amy Coney Barrett is eminently qualified to be Justice of SCOTUS. While I personally disagree with Originalism, it is a serious and significant judicial philosophy that merits a serious and sober response. Instead the left is attacking her shamelessly for her personal beliefs which have nothing to do with her as Judge (Since when did being religious become a crime in the USA?), and her originalism. 

What the Dems and the liberals in general are doing is painting all originalists as nutjobs and originalism as a farce. I remember how the liberal media painted Justice Scalia as some sort of a cartoonish monster. Recently, I listened to him explain originalism and I was in awe of his intelligence. He is a legal giant that the left attacked shamelessly. Again, I disagree with him, but I admire how intelligent he was, and how compelling his philosophy was. ACB is going to be a true heir of his.

What the left needs to understand is, that you can have fundamental disagreements about judicial philosophy and still have profound respect for those you disagree with. This is the relationship that Justices Scalia and Ginsburg shared. In many ways, they were complete opposites in the Court, but they were also very good friends outside of it. I am sure that the Court is still largely collegial even in these partisan times. 

Which brings me to another point. Judges aren't really Democrat or Republican judges. This is why you get decisions where Judges don't decide how they are expected to. A good Judge decides the law based on her understand of it, and how it applies to the case. This is exactly what ACB has said she will do, and this is all you can ask of Judge.",hot,Republican

Concerning Political Minority at Universities,6,jb7s6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/jb7s6z/concerning_political_minority_at_universities/,1,1602732988.0,"We all know the Soviet playbook and we all know why universities are becoming overwhelmingly pro-""socialist."" Why the campus commie pawns are so bold and confident in their impunity for harassing us. I will just cut to the chase.

I attend another, typical large Uni where the Republicans mostly keep their heads down and are regularly attacked at their political events. Very Marxist school. I am under the college of ""Liberal Arts and Sciences."" There was (I feel) a very pre-loaded, opinionative scholarship essay that I  submitted to the college. It required us to agree or disagree on whether facts were objective or not and then support our claims by speculating the evolution of the ""post-truth era"" phenomenon (you may know exactly what school I'm referring to based on this information alone. I ask you to please chill).

Anyway, I answered as you would expect and I answered truthfully. In summary, my two theories were: late-Roman-style societal decline, and, of course, decades of intentional, foreign-national, communist, subversive undermining.

My biggest mistake was answering truthfully. Not only did I not get the scholarship, but I have potentially marked myself for the overwhelmingly pro-communist administration. Administration in question is the dean's office of the college. Up there. Not my department heads or even chair.


My question is: has anyone else had a similar experience like this? Do the big heads ""talk"" to each other? Did I just blackball myself and make my life harder? Has anyone marked themselves ""the enemy"" to them and paid for it? Please share.",hot,Republican

Electoral College and Popular Vote,4,jan1jw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/jan1jw/electoral_college_and_popular_vote/,17,1602653722.0,"This is a question, but not one to debate whether one method should exist over the other. My question is, why does America still count individual votes when the Electoral College votes deem the victor? I hear arguments giving examples like if the popular vote is split 70-30 (or higher), the popular vote matters. The more common argument is that the popular vote ""helps electors determine who they are voting for""...which is hardly an argument since electors are not constitutionally bound to vote a particular party - regardless of how distasteful that may be. 

To my understanding, we are democratic in nature on a state level - leading to us determining electors during primary elections. It is then, that we hope, our electors we voted into place will elect our president, thus giving us our representative republic. Yeah, idk the purpose of the popular vote....for fun?",hot,Republican

"Well, I'm voting straight-ticket Republican, Trump and all",1071,j9k80m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j9k80m/well_im_voting_straightticket_republican_trump/,305,1602505454.0,"I made this username a couple years ago and that was my sentiment at the time. I was never a 'vote blue no matter who' type because that mentality allows the DNC to do whatever they want, and I frankly won't be told to fall in line. I voted 3rd party in '04, Obama in '08, 3rd party in '12 and '16. State and local politicians I've voted for have mostly been Democrat. My views have never fallen cleanly on one side or the other, but I've mostly leaned liberal.

This brings me to Why I'm Voting Republican:  
1. Woke shit. I've been on the receiving end of woke hatred over men who fancy themselves women for a long time. I'm well acquainted with critical theory and all its crazy spawn. I'm not down for the struggle sessions, the authoritarianism, the illiberal silencing of dissent. Now that we have Evergreen playing out in the streets, schools, and HR departments across the Western world, I have no choice but to vote for the party standing against it. This alone would be enough for me to vote for Trump.  
2. Media is lying to me. I believed those pictures of kids in cages were put there by Trump. I believed the shooting of Breonna Taylor was the result of a no-knock warrant executed on the wrong address. I believed Trump said neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching with tiki torches were ""fine people."" Turns out I was a sucker, and god damn am I *tired* of this ""peaceful protester"" shit the media is on about.  
3. Fuck the DNC. I wanted Bernie in 2016 and we all know how dirty they did him. When Trump won, my immediate thought was 'at least the DNC will learn their fucking lesson.' Well friends, they're much more resistant to learning than I anticipated. This time around there were a few candidates I could have gotten on board with, but of course the DNC won't let anyone remotely subversive get on the ticket. Fuck em.  
4. LAW AND ORDER. I live in Oregon. It's not going well. Fuck antifa. Fuck BLM. Fuck Kate Brown. Fuck Ted Wheeler. Fuck everyone allowing tent cities full of junkies to blight the landscape. Fuck every 'ACAB' sniveling child.  
5. Yay middle east peace deals.  
6. Fuck China.  
7. Biden is frail and will be 78 and Harris is terrifying and I haaaate her.  
8. Working class. I don't know when the Democrats decided they weren't the party of labor, but now they mostly look down their ivory tower noses at anyone with a little mud on their boots.  
9. Democrats talking about court packing. No, no, no, hell no.  
10. Democrats talking about getting rid of the electoral college, thus disenfranchising the interests of rural people. Nope, never gonna happen.  
11. I'm patriotic. I don't like that seeing an American flag on someone's house, vehicle, or clothing is a pretty good indicator of them being a Republican. Regarding the Democrat party and liberals in general, where is their love of country? ‚ÄúNational pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement.‚Äù ‚Äï Richard Rorty

As for Trump himself, I think he's a boor. But he's not as big of a bastard as I had believed and I understand him a bit better. He's gonna win for sure, which is not something I thought before the riots started. I'm preemptively pissed about the future of abortion rights, but at least my free speech and gun rights will remain intact. With those two, I have a seat at the table to fight for the rest. 

I'm honestly hoping for a landslide because I think it might be the only thing that can slap liberals hard enough they wake up and get on a better path. The nation works best when there is a healthy push and pull between liberalism and conservatism, and we need to be able to agree on the foundational structures of our country. I see a huge number of left-leaning people refusing to come to the table to talk and wanting to break our system when they don't get their way, and making it clear that won't win them power is the issue of the election.",hot,Republican

Yes I know, not Republican, but I side with y'all on most economic issues and gun rights. I can't wholeheartedly support either the Red or Blue candidates this year but the level of disinformation from the left is insane, I often find myself defending Trump against unwarranted claims and exposing Biden because the media thinks his shit doesn't stink. As a libertarian, I respect all rights equally. We may disagree on Gay Rights, Abortion, and Drug Decriminalization; but our core values are the same. I want truth in politics, equal media representation of positives and negatives on both sides. Right now, the Democrats are lying WAY more. What I fear the most is a Democrat in office with the power of the media behind him because he can change so much without any visible media resistance. Social Media is against you, mass media is against you, the truth is twisted tremendously against you. While my beliefs don't align exclusively with Trump or his platform, I feel that Biden is in a position to create a much larger and extended threat to American freedoms. I post this so that we may learn from each other, not argue. Please delete if not allowed, but I truly hope that we can spur a dialogue that is beneficial for America as a whole.",hot,Republican

VP Debate: one part that really stuck with me on the difference between Democrats and Republicans,831,j82tlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j82tlu/vp_debate_one_part_that_really_stuck_with_me_on/,95,1602291751.0,"I was watching a rerun of  the VP debate yesterday (I know I‚Äôm late) and one line (I guess one part) that really stuck with me about the difference between Democrats and Republicans. 

I forget what exactly was said but Harris was berating Pence for not social distancing / wearing masks / etc. Pence‚Äôs reply really stuck with me because it was along the lines of ‚ÄúYou want to tell people what to do, we trust the American people are smart enough to think for themselves‚Äù

And that line really really stuck with me. I came here from Russia years ago and while I was born after the iron curtain fell, my parents weren‚Äôt so lucky. So many stories about ‚Äúknowing a guy‚Äù, countless instances of ‚Äúback door favors‚Äù

These aren‚Äôt evil people, just regular folks trying to get by (grandma was a teacher, gramps was an engineer in a factory). All this shit they had to do, was because the fucking government made regular life impossible.  To me even I hate authority on that level, I just hate people telling me what to do because I feel like ‚Äúhey man do you think I‚Äôm dumb ‚Äú

Democrats seem to be in this backslide or more and more regulations and I saw it first hand on a recent trip to Cali. While I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, the whole place just felt ‚ÄúOver regulated‚Äù, which is a real fucking shame because it‚Äôs gorgeous there. 

Republicans on the other hand are more keen on stepping back and building a solid foundation for you to go off of. I don‚Äôt need the government doing everything for me, just please give me the basics and I got it from here. 

I feel like Pence‚Äôs comment is a complete reflection of this difference in ideas. I don‚Äôt agree with everything the Republicans do but one thing I am 100% on board with is the notion of ‚Äúhey we‚Äôre just going to leave you the fuck alone‚Äù

Edit: Thanks for the pin mods.

Edit 2: Found a good opinion piece from the LA Times that illustrates the ‚Äúover regulation‚Äù in Cali very well, particularly when it comes to housing https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-broughel-hamilton-overregulation-housing-california-20190703-story.html",hot,Republican

Watching both the Presidential and VP debates, I love Pence‚Äôs debate style. He‚Äôs calm, cool, collected, doesn‚Äôt get heated. He demolished Harris and it wasn‚Äôt even close, why do you think everyone is focusing on the fly? I just wish Trump would realize his counter-punching and bulldog nature of wanting to bite back as soon as possible makes you seem very unprofessional. Pence waited for Harris to spew her nonsense, and he just straight up steamrolled her. I‚Äôm not saying Trump is a bad debater, but he just can‚Äôt not help himself when he wants to speak.

I can't help but look at the Democrats with disgust nowadays and I'll never vote for them again.

I'm pro choice up to ~12 weeks, but I would laugh my ass off if Roe V Wade went bye bye. I almost want it gone just to spite the left.

Packing the Supreme Court is completely insane.

They're basically trying to abolish the 2nd Amendment at this point.

I have this weird feeling lingering in the back of my head of ""Am I a conservative? Or are Democrats on a never ending journey to move left?""

Or as some may say ""I didn't leave the left. The left left me.""

She basically admonished the U.S. for taking a trade position against China, and in her veiled insult about world leaders respecting Xi Jinping more than Trump, while it may have  *sounded* like an insult to Trump, it was really a veiled accolade of Xi Jinping. Just go back and listen to that comment stand alone. Incredible.

Virtual Debate and Internal Campaign Polling,2,j7cvyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j7cvyt/virtual_debate_and_internal_campaign_polling/,1,1602191981.0,"I don't care whether for someone is for Joe Biden or President Trump, but a virtual debate is not the same as an in-person debate. America doesn't deserve to see our two potential presidents looking at computer screens with candidates potentially having written down answers to topics on paper right in-front of them.

I applaud President Trump for not wanting to do a virtual debate. I think he should say take all precautions you need to, but have the debate in-person. A virtual debate is a fraud.

If Biden was so far ahead as almost every major news outlet claims:

Why is Biden going to Minnesota?

Why is he campaigning at all if he's winning the electoral college?

Why is Biden going to Pennsylvania so much?

Why is Biden not touting he's winning?

Why do Harris and Biden look so defensive when pressed?

Why is Biden suddenly campaigning in-person and knocking on doors if he is ahead?

The clear answer to me is they're not doing well in their internal polls and it shows. I think Pence's response that 2 million people could've died if they hadn't shut the economy down or blocked travel from China and comparing Biden's actions on swine flu to this virus was a great answer when he was asked about coronavirus last night.",hot,Republican

-2020 vice presidential debate. 10/17/2020

I sit here and type with giddy enjoyment. I just watched the 2020 vice presidential debate, and I could not be more pleased with the performance. Right out of the gate Mike Pence seemed to be an ordinary candidate. Someone who is an expert at appealing to emotion and unrelated topics. At first, I was disappointed; I did not know anything about Mike Pence before this debate. However, after the first few questions I quickly learned all about this candidates‚Äô character. He was sharp and precise but also knew how to tug on your heart strings. He was almost impulsive in the way he gave pleasantries to both the moderator and Kamala Harris. Event when he was arguing he kept his dignity and respect for the platform. 

Kamala, on the other hand, had no respect for her counterpart. At every chance she struck at even the smallest kinks in Pence‚Äôs armor. Whenever she spoke, she had an air of arrogance and pride. Instead of addressing the questions she simply rambled, changed the topic, or attacked her opponents‚Äô character. From time to time she began to give an intelligible response, but it inevitably faded into societally pleasing nonsense. She had no grip on morals or plans; her campaign hangs in the explosion of people who are willfully ignorant to the far left‚Äôs rhetoric. For once in America we are recognizing what the left truly is. They are nothing but a band of tyrannical masters of sophistry, who seek nothing but control of our great constitutional republic. 

Simply put, this is not an election about race, economy, or environment. This election is about our constitutional republic‚Ä¶or their rendition of it. Heed my warnings, they will not be kind to your freedoms. At first everything will seem good. The social activism groups will come together and praise the presidency. The Media will tell great tales of vast social justice, peace, and economic prosperity. This, however, will not last long. Using the corona virus, they will begin to infringe on your rights beyond what was ever thought possible by the original constitution. They will start to morph the very fabric of our constitutional republic. Things will fall apart, and power always comes in the place of vulnerability. Soon we will be just another example of why socialism never works‚Ä¶..

Why Biden Is In Trouble,7,j71tt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j71tt0/why_biden_is_in_trouble/,8,1602141742.0,"This is a little long but I wanted to just try to put some of the fears we all have had about this election aside. 

I know we've all been worried about mail in balloting and we've all seen CNN, NBC, Fox polls all claiming Biden has an insurmountable lead. Here's why this isn't such as issue as you might think. There have been five to five and a half ballots already returned or people that have voted early. We know Democrat voters are more likely to vote by mail but at least some of those votes are for Trump.

In 2016, Hillary received almost 66 million votes compared to Trump at 63 million. As one other person has said on a comment I read, Biden probably needs at least 16 million ballots for him in by the end of this month since a lot of his voters will vote by mail. Also, Democrat mayors in the midwestern states, a couple Democrat congressman from state legislatures like Ohio, and the governor of Puerto Rico backing Trump - that means he likely has even more support than he did four years ago. In addition, he also has the police and lawn enforcement unions backing him and will probably win a lot of the hispanic/latino vote in Florida that come from Cuba. While there is no way he will win a majority of black voters this election, I think some of them will move to Trump because of record low unemployment and wages were rising prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Unlike 2016, Trump has a record and he has delivered on everything he said he would do.

In addition, in most of the battleground states - the Republicans have already won or will win in court on mail in balloting. Governors and judges can't just change state election law by themselves without their legislatures doing so. Except for the military that can't help when their ballots come in because they are from overseas, I think the courts will decide that ballots need to be turned in by Election Day in almost all of the states.

Furthermore, we know that most Biden voters are actually voting against Trump a lot more than for Biden. That means they are likely to vote early and get it over with prior to Election Day. I don't know what percentage of Biden votes will be in by the middle or end of this month, but if Biden doesn't get a total of more than 66 million votes, it's hard to see him prevailing. The two polls that were right in 2016 (IBD and Tralfalgar) have Trump doing really well. Yes, Biden has raised a lot of money but it's not overwhelming and as we saw in 2016, money doesn't always buy elections.

If Biden had a lead, don't you think he would be going around the country touting it like Hillary did or staying in his basement? He's not doing that now - all of a sudden he's doing in person events, knocking on doors, and visiting battleground states (all of which he said was dangerous for Trump to do because of the virus). That is not what a campaign does that thinks they have this election in the bag. Internal polling is much more reliable and we can infer who's leading by how the Biden campaign is acting. Biden is going to Minnesota and Pennsylvania the most - both states the media has all but declared to be for Biden this election. I think Trump is doing much better in all the battleground states (maybe even New Hampshire) than everyone thinks.

I doubt the coronavirus takes much votes away from Trump honestly just because Trump voters tend to look at the overall picture and see what a Biden presidency could do to the economy, the Supreme Court... In addition, Biden has been seen in his CNN and NBC town halls and around people not wearing a mask and at times not social distancing. That is all what his campaign is about essentially - wearing a mask. 

My point is - don't freak out. You can do something right now to help the Trump campaign - go to [https://www.donaldjtrump.com](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) and donate right now. If you live in a battleground state, donate to the GOP in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Ohio, and maybe even North Carolina just to ensure we win that state. Beyond that, enthusiasm is on our side. Historically, the candidate that is only against the other like Biden is does not win.

Make sure you vote, make sure your friends and family are registered, and make sure they vote to reelect the President on November 3rd! Trump just needs to emphasize that we have treatments for this virus now and we are increasing the survival rate for covid. We can't bring back any lives lost from covid but if the president says we are doing this in honor of them and at the same time touts a vaccine coming early next year or late this year, I think he wins.",hot,Republican

So naturally, in the past few months I have tried to shed light on all the amazing things police and military do for us. Because they have gotten HORRIBLY disrespected. 

One of my best friends and I went to a blue lives rally. Posted about it on Instagram. Did not engage with liberals. But lo and behold, within 48 hours the post accumulates 1,500 comments.

A trans conservative view on trans rights.,6,j6krj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j6krj8/a_trans_conservative_view_on_trans_rights/,8,1602074897.0,"Trans conservatives view on being trans.
First let me introduce myself to this sub reddit. I‚Äôm trans and politically consider myself to be a conservative. It‚Äôs not the easiest balance however lol. I debated back and forth about doing this and just kept pushing it off. However I‚Äôm really curious to see peoples responses. I‚Äôm starting hrt soon and I don‚Äôt Pass yet (caterpillar) 

Why am I doing this? When you tell someone your trans they automatically think that you‚Äôre a liberal democrat. However I‚Äôm actually pro gun rights, pro life, and I believe in our need to strengthen the US economy. I vote Republican. The main reason however that I‚Äôm doing this is because I can't seem to pin point the exact republican view on being trans.

I will now lay out my beliefs on trans rights from a trans conservative perspective in full detail. Also I‚Äôm a trans woman so a lot of what I write will be from that perspective.

Terms:

HRT (hormone replacement therapy) HRT changes a person‚Äôs body fat placement hair growth muscle growth and skin smoothing based on if your taking estrogen or testosterone.

Pre-OP (before bottom surgery) someone who as the genitals of their sex

Post-OP (after bottom surgery) someone who as surgery in order to have the genitals of the sex they wish to be.

Passing: someone who looks exactly like the opposite gender. Basically it‚Äôs a trans person who passes as their preferred gender

What‚Äôs it like being trans?
It‚Äôs not easy to explain but I‚Äôll try my best. Imagine that when you look in the mirror you feel like thiers something off. You hate your body but you don‚Äôt know why. You may look very attractive and yet you feel like the ugliest scum of the earth. Also imagine that when you hang out with your friends and an attractive person walks by and everyone is discussing about how much they wished they were dating that person all you can think about is being that person.

For me personally I also hate my height. I‚Äôm over 6 feet tall.  Whenever I complaim about feeling like a monster all my friends reassure me that they are jealous of my height. I however would do anything to be under six feet tall. I want to be a cute small girl and knowing how that‚Äôs impossible causes me immense distress.

Is being trans a mental illness?
The cause of being trans is Gender dysphoria which is a mental illness. I can honestly say it sucks hating the body you‚Äôre born in.

What‚Äôs the cure?
To transition into the gender your brain tells you that you should be. I can honestly say that I feel pure joy when I do things as a girl even if they are small things. The kind of pure joy I feel when I do things as a girl is comparable to the pure joy I felt as a kid going to Disney.

Do I have to treat a trans woman as a woman and a trans man as a man?

If someone asks you to call them a girl or a guy I think that the nice thing to do is to call them she/her or he/him but I also understand that you are under no obligation to do so and I don‚Äôt think we should get upset if someone refuses to do so. That being said I have no problem with someone not feeling comfortable treating me as a girl if I looked like a guy but if I passed I would feel like the person is only doing it to be rude and they would lose my respect.

Should a trans person be allowed to change their sex on their birth certificate?

Yes if they are post-OP. In order to get bottom surgery you have to have been on hrt for two years. By this time you have many of the secondary sex characteristics as your counter part. If you also get bottom surgery on top of that I do believe that you should change the sex on your documents. Most conservative states agree with me on this.

Should a trans person use the opposite gender bathroom?

You should use the bathroom of the sex on your birth certificate. So if they get the birth certificate changed then yes. Before that no.

I‚Äôm attracted to someone who is trans am I gay?

This depends on how well they pass. A trans woman who has been on hrt for several years has curves boobs and all the other secondary sex characteristics of a female. So no if they pass your not gay.

I found out someone was trans so I ended our relationship with them was that wrong?

Yes. If they were a good person and you loved them then I do think it‚Äôs pretty shitty to end things because they were once a guy or girl. However there are aspects that I fully understand. If they are pre-op and that makes you uncomfortable I understand ending things. Also if you want kids a trans woman can‚Äôt get pregnant. Adoption is always an option but some people really desire to have their own biological kids. So I also understand ending things for that reason. Although thanks to some new research it may be possible in the future for a trans woman to give birth. Basically the only reason I would think you‚Äôre a shitty person would be if your only reason to end things was because who they were in the past.

Should a trans woman compete in womans sports?
No. Even though hrt decreases muscle size (that‚Äôs the reason why a trans woman can‚Äôt compete in mens sports. Also proof that men are naturally stronger than woman.) It doesn‚Äôt change other things like height. For example on hrt I may have the muscle mass of a woman but I would still be over 6 feet tall. I would have an unfair advantage. Trans women shouldn‚Äôt compete in mens or womans sports. You can still live an active life without being into competitive sports.

When should a trans person be allowed to transition?

18 is when a person should be allowed to transition. I know a lot of trans people wish they could have transitioned as a kid. I am also one of those trans people. That being said it‚Äôs very hard to determine if someone is suffering from gender dysphoria at that young of an age. I do think that if a therapist is involved and it is fully explored it can be possible for someone to transition before 18 but only with parental permission from both parents.

I ultimately view being trans as being a caterpillar trying to be a butterfly. I don‚Äôt think someone who is a caterpillar should be treated as a butterfly. However they will get their eventually and then they should be treated differently. Even if becoming a butterfly is impossible and you can only become a moth your still not the caterpillar you once where. 

Can a trans woman or man truly become a man or woman?

No. It‚Äôs impossible to change yourself to be exactly like the opposite gender. Still a trans person who passes should be treated as the gender they are trying to achieve.

Why are most trans people upset by these beliefs?
As you can tell I put a large emphasis on passing and medical transition. However a lot of trans people believe that none passing trans people with no medical intervention should be treated as their gender of choice. I disagree.

Are you a Satanist?

A lot of people associate being trans with being satanic I honestly don‚Äôt know why. I believe in God and I am strongly pro religious freedom. I don‚Äôt prescribe to a specific religion. I‚Äôve been told a lot that being trans is a sin which keeps me away from prescribing to a specific religion. I don‚Äôt believe that being trans is inherently wrong.

I've basically made all these beliefs myself. I tried to find out what conservative opinions where on being trans but I usually just found negative news articles or girl dick jokes. I think more trans people would vote Republican if they knew the exact Republican stance.

Please tell me your thoughts and feel free to ask me questions I‚Äôll try my best to answer them whenever I get a chance. I‚Äôm interested to know how everyone here views being trans. Also if you didn‚Äôt hold an opinion before I hope that I caused you to give this subject some thought.

Trump also implemented a 20% Small Business Deduction, lowered corporate taxes and repealed obamacare penalties.

It would be interesting to find a chart comparing income vs political affiliation. As income increases (and your taxes) it would seem logical you'd vote for the party that lowers your tax burden. People who are takers dont mind voting for higher taxes, as long as its someone else paying for it.

As fairly recent follower of America politics (just got a job in Canada for an American company) I'd like to ask this sub for some info, and hopefully you all can help me out. All of my questions are geared toward what makes a Republican a Republican. To that end, I'd like to ask about your values. Please be specific if possible, for example, ""Freedom of Speech"" is a value, but ""Freedom"" would be a bit too generic for what I'm looking for.

1) What are unique core republican values, ranked in order of importance? Unique as in they are qualities the majority of Republicans desire their government to possess while a majority of Democrats wouldn't, or at least not as much.

2) What do you believe are core American values? Beliefs that, in your experience, Republicans and Democrats both agree upon? 

3) Lastly, what do you believe are unique Democrat values? Traits that a majority of Democrats desire in/from their government that a majority of Republicans would not.

Looking for a fair and objective response. Thanks in advance!

For those of you who may not know who Rooster Teeth are, they‚Äôre a media company that makes online content about video games, anime, live action shorts, etc. They‚Äôve been around for nearly 20 years, but this past year has been hell for them. They claim to be a very accepting and loving company of all values and genders and all that good stuff, which is cool. They‚Äôre all about equality and constant virtue signaling, but it‚Äôs all for show. A former employee, who is a black woman, came out a couple months ago explaining that the company treated her very poorly, like the ‚Äútoken black girl‚Äù essentially. Inappropriate race jokes and pretending to care about her made up a great portion of the reason as to why she left. And of course, all the employees acted all innocent and ‚Äúshould‚Äôve spoke up sooner‚Äù, yeah, ok, like y‚Äôall totally care now that y‚Äôall got called out on y‚Äôall hypocritical BS. Another founding employee got very quietly let go for condemning the riots in the streets in the wake of the George Floyd incident a few months back. Other prominent employees got let go in massive layoffs, and the final nail in the coffin, two of their employees (married employees, I might add) were sleeping with fans right under their noses. This dumpster fire of a a company is another shining example of how virtue signaling and pretending to care about race issues, sexual assault, and various other causes while letting it happen in your own workplace anyway causes you to ‚ÄúGet Woke, Go Broke.‚Äù RIP Rooster Teeth",new,Republican

I started paying attention when the democratic governor of my rural state locked down and closed schools, in a clear push to make a name for herself. Then democrats refused to denounce violent riots, and worse, let these fester by not cracking down on them or prosecuting criminals.  

I didn't vote in 2016, mainly because Trump was incoherent, and lacked decorum. I was caught up in starting a family, and climbing the ladder at work. Now, after three years of prosperity, being a homeowner, a parent, and starting to accumulate some actual money, I can't fathom voting for a democrat in the 2020 election, even though they seem poised to take the Senate and maintain the House. Even if this happens, I think the future of the Republican Party is bright. I look at young, articulate conservatives like Ben Sasse, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, and contrast that to The Squad, and I have hope. I look at an emboldened Ted Cruz, and have hope. I also look at conservatives that are influencers like Candace Owens, and Ben Shapiro and I have hope. 

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest, because I can't hardly share my newfound conservatism in the public sphere without retaliation. Who else are the beacons of a bright conservative future?",new,Republican

So the top comment was a Latino man stating simply ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not Latinx, it‚Äôs Latino‚Äù, which received dozens of likes fairly quickly. So I responded, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so weird how Latino people and culture have no problem with the word Latino but woke white people gotta butt in and act like they know what‚Äôs best for a community.‚Äù I received quite a few likes from various Latino people, and a few replies saying that ‚ÄúFinally, someone gets it‚Äù. But of course, a couple woke white women had to butt in and proceeded to explain to a bunch of ACTUAL Latinos that ‚ÄúLatinx‚Äù is actually the correct term and those Latinos were wrong. The backlash was glorious, the Latinos absolutely destroyed those women, and those women showed their true racist colors. I ended up DMing the original commenter and we got to talking and apparently he will be voting Trump and the Latino community sees this a lot from woke white people, this very talking down to attitude and treatment as if they are stupid. He voted for Obama but had an ‚Äúaha‚Äù moment a few years ago and kinda realized this whole victim mentality and ‚Äúwhite savior‚Äù BS was stupid.

These women could not attack ACB on her legal credentials. They had to boil her down to her genitalia and make her a traitor to her sex because they couldn‚Äôt imagine a reality in which a woman may hold conservative ideals. 

I always try to assume best intentions, and looking back (I am middle-aged) I feel I have only experienced true sexism from a man twice.  Neither incident was major and I handled both on my own. I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt happen, I am saying that I haven‚Äôt experienced it.

The only long lasting, brutal bullying I have ever experienced has been from other women, and it was due to the same reason Twitter doofs were going after ACB.  I fail to conform. If I disagree or have my own mind, I say so, and I‚Äôm frank about it but not an asshole. 

Even if it‚Äôs something minor, especially in the professional setting, many women view this as aggression and move to single out the offender. 

One could opine for days why this happens, but I think it‚Äôs critical to note that radical feminism ENCOURAGES this to happen. 

The culture that encourages unbelievers to be singled out and attacked is the number one reason I can‚Äôt hang with feminism, which means I also can‚Äôt hang with the leadership at my church, which has shifted radically liberal. My job has an overwhelmingly liberal tilt (education) so I cannot speak freely there, either. 

In all of these arenas, if I am singled out, it has been unilaterally by other women. So, on an emotional level, I really felt for ACB, as I‚Äôve had similar experiences on a less bombastic scale.",new,Republican

The story is actively being attempted to be taken down so make sure to screen shot and download. 

Can't believe no one is covering this. 

DLA Piper and BGR Group are representing a county that is currently employing ISIS Jihadi fighters in a war zone against a small Christian county (Armenia) where there is evidence of war crimes being committed by Kamala's husbands firms client. There was a video of Azerbaijan fighters beheading their enemies. Yes these are the same ISIS fighters killing our Troop abroad and spreading terror in the world. They are buying influence.

DLA Piper's job is to make Azerbeijan look democratic and free with PR efforts in the USA with think tanks and influencing important politicians.  

Trump and Secretary of State Pompeo just put a end to their use of think tanks to add in their effort. 

https://www.politico.com/news/2020/10/13/trump-think-tanks-foreign-funding-429209

Azerbaijan ranks last in the world in freedom of Press. No freedom of speech. The Vice President of the county is the current presidents wife who he appointed. The last President was his father.  WTF?  In US media, due to DLA Piper efforts they are portrayed as a Free and Democratic country, but in reality this is another North Korea. Seriously look for yourself.

For instance, everyone knows about the KKK, and even though they are considered to be more of a conservative party, no one likes them, INCLUDING conservatives, obviously because they‚Äôre bigots who kill black people.


And yet, with liberals around these particular elections they seem to only think of violence and murder. I see plenty of videos of people sobbing because of the rioters and looters destroying their businesses. And BLM has also caused a lot of murder, and yet not only do liberals condone this behavior, they actively ENCOURAGE people to be violent and burn down buildings just to make a point, which is awful.


And also liberals claim to be the ‚Äúwoke‚Äù party, and yet the people in their party are just as racist,sexist, and bullying as any I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôm honestly convinced most politicians are two cheeks of the same ass, because I‚Äôve seen the videos,photos,tweets,etc, of plenty of liberal politicians saying and doing racist things/rude things and also some who have had bad allegations against them, for instance:


Biden: ‚Äú If you don‚Äôt vote for me you ain‚Äôt black‚Äù


Cardi B drugged and robbed men


Billie Eilish said racial slurs against Asians


Chrissy Teigen supposedly bullied a teenager


Justin Trudeau wore blackface


Elizabeth Warren has been accused of treating women of color like crap and many have left her campaign.

Liberal treatment of ACB is shocking- A liberal perspective,17,jbf6xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/jbf6xr/liberal_treatment_of_acb_is_shocking_a_liberal/,6,1602758106.0,"I had a few thoughts that I am not even sure the left is ready to hear. So I am posting them here. 

It is clear that Judge Amy Coney Barrett is eminently qualified to be Justice of SCOTUS. While I personally disagree with Originalism, it is a serious and significant judicial philosophy that merits a serious and sober response. Instead the left is attacking her shamelessly for her personal beliefs which have nothing to do with her as Judge (Since when did being religious become a crime in the USA?), and her originalism. 

What the Dems and the liberals in general are doing is painting all originalists as nutjobs and originalism as a farce. I remember how the liberal media painted Justice Scalia as some sort of a cartoonish monster. Recently, I listened to him explain originalism and I was in awe of his intelligence. He is a legal giant that the left attacked shamelessly. Again, I disagree with him, but I admire how intelligent he was, and how compelling his philosophy was. ACB is going to be a true heir of his.

What the left needs to understand is, that you can have fundamental disagreements about judicial philosophy and still have profound respect for those you disagree with. This is the relationship that Justices Scalia and Ginsburg shared. In many ways, they were complete opposites in the Court, but they were also very good friends outside of it. I am sure that the Court is still largely collegial even in these partisan times. 

Which brings me to another point. Judges aren't really Democrat or Republican judges. This is why you get decisions where Judges don't decide how they are expected to. A good Judge decides the law based on her understand of it, and how it applies to the case. This is exactly what ACB has said she will do, and this is all you can ask of Judge.",new,Republican

Why the campus commie pawns are so bold and confident in their impunity for harassing us. I will just cut to the chase.

I attend another, typical large Uni where the Republicans mostly keep their heads down and are regularly attacked at their political events. Very Marxist school. I am under the college of ""Liberal Arts and Sciences."" There was (I feel) a very pre-loaded, opinionative scholarship essay that I  submitted to the college. It required us to agree or disagree on whether facts were objective or not and then support our claims by speculating the evolution of the ""post-truth era"" phenomenon (you may know exactly what school I'm referring to based on this information alone. I ask you to please chill).

Anyway, I answered as you would expect and I answered truthfully. In summary, my two theories were: late-Roman-style societal decline, and, of course, decades of intentional, foreign-national, communist, subversive undermining.

My biggest mistake was answering truthfully. Not only did I not get the scholarship, but I have potentially marked myself for the overwhelmingly pro-communist administration. Administration in question is the dean's office of the college. Up there. Not my department heads or even chair.


My question is: has anyone else had a similar experience like this? Do the big heads ""talk"" to each other? Did I just blackball myself and make my life harder? Has anyone marked themselves ""the enemy"" to them and paid for it? Please share.",new,Republican

My question is, why does America still count individual votes when the Electoral College votes deem the victor? I hear arguments giving examples like if the popular vote is split 70-30 (or higher), the popular vote matters. The more common argument is that the popular vote ""helps electors determine who they are voting for""...which is hardly an argument since electors are not constitutionally bound to vote a particular party - regardless of how distasteful that may be. 

To my understanding, we are democratic in nature on a state level - leading to us determining electors during primary elections. It is then, that we hope, our electors we voted into place will elect our president, thus giving us our representative republic. Yeah, idk the purpose of the popular vote....for fun?",new,Republican

"Well, I'm voting straight-ticket Republican, Trump and all",1068,j9k80m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j9k80m/well_im_voting_straightticket_republican_trump/,305,1602505454.0,"I made this username a couple years ago and that was my sentiment at the time. I was never a 'vote blue no matter who' type because that mentality allows the DNC to do whatever they want, and I frankly won't be told to fall in line. I voted 3rd party in '04, Obama in '08, 3rd party in '12 and '16. State and local politicians I've voted for have mostly been Democrat. My views have never fallen cleanly on one side or the other, but I've mostly leaned liberal.

This brings me to Why I'm Voting Republican:  
1. Woke shit. I've been on the receiving end of woke hatred over men who fancy themselves women for a long time. I'm well acquainted with critical theory and all its crazy spawn. I'm not down for the struggle sessions, the authoritarianism, the illiberal silencing of dissent. Now that we have Evergreen playing out in the streets, schools, and HR departments across the Western world, I have no choice but to vote for the party standing against it. This alone would be enough for me to vote for Trump.  
2. Media is lying to me. I believed those pictures of kids in cages were put there by Trump. I believed the shooting of Breonna Taylor was the result of a no-knock warrant executed on the wrong address. I believed Trump said neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching with tiki torches were ""fine people."" Turns out I was a sucker, and god damn am I *tired* of this ""peaceful protester"" shit the media is on about.  
3. Fuck the DNC. I wanted Bernie in 2016 and we all know how dirty they did him. When Trump won, my immediate thought was 'at least the DNC will learn their fucking lesson.' Well friends, they're much more resistant to learning than I anticipated. This time around there were a few candidates I could have gotten on board with, but of course the DNC won't let anyone remotely subversive get on the ticket. Fuck em.  
4. LAW AND ORDER. I live in Oregon. It's not going well. Fuck antifa. Fuck BLM. Fuck Kate Brown. Fuck Ted Wheeler. Fuck everyone allowing tent cities full of junkies to blight the landscape. Fuck every 'ACAB' sniveling child.  
5. Yay middle east peace deals.  
6. Fuck China.  
7. Biden is frail and will be 78 and Harris is terrifying and I haaaate her.  
8. Working class. I don't know when the Democrats decided they weren't the party of labor, but now they mostly look down their ivory tower noses at anyone with a little mud on their boots.  
9. Democrats talking about court packing. No, no, no, hell no.  
10. Democrats talking about getting rid of the electoral college, thus disenfranchising the interests of rural people. Nope, never gonna happen.  
11. I'm patriotic. I don't like that seeing an American flag on someone's house, vehicle, or clothing is a pretty good indicator of them being a Republican. Regarding the Democrat party and liberals in general, where is their love of country? ‚ÄúNational pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement.‚Äù ‚Äï Richard Rorty

As for Trump himself, I think he's a boor. But he's not as big of a bastard as I had believed and I understand him a bit better. He's gonna win for sure, which is not something I thought before the riots started. I'm preemptively pissed about the future of abortion rights, but at least my free speech and gun rights will remain intact. With those two, I have a seat at the table to fight for the rest. 

I'm honestly hoping for a landslide because I think it might be the only thing that can slap liberals hard enough they wake up and get on a better path. The nation works best when there is a healthy push and pull between liberalism and conservatism, and we need to be able to agree on the foundational structures of our country. I see a huge number of left-leaning people refusing to come to the table to talk and wanting to break our system when they don't get their way, and making it clear that won't win them power is the issue of the election.",new,Republican

A Libertarian seeking common ground with Republicans because the Democrat subs are screaming children,541,j9a1t6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j9a1t6/a_libertarian_seeking_common_ground_with/,209,1602467889.0,"Hello folks, libertarian here. Yes I know, not Republican, but I side with y'all on most economic issues and gun rights. I can't wholeheartedly support either the Red or Blue candidates this year but the level of disinformation from the left is insane, I often find myself defending Trump against unwarranted claims and exposing Biden because the media thinks his shit doesn't stink. As a libertarian, I respect all rights equally. We may disagree on Gay Rights, Abortion, and Drug Decriminalization; but our core values are the same. I want truth in politics, equal media representation of positives and negatives on both sides. Right now, the Democrats are lying WAY more. What I fear the most is a Democrat in office with the power of the media behind him because he can change so much without any visible media resistance. Social Media is against you, mass media is against you, the truth is twisted tremendously against you. While my beliefs don't align exclusively with Trump or his platform, I feel that Biden is in a position to create a much larger and extended threat to American freedoms. I post this so that we may learn from each other, not argue. Please delete if not allowed, but I truly hope that we can spur a dialogue that is beneficial for America as a whole.",new,Republican

VP Debate: one part that really stuck with me on the difference between Democrats and Republicans,832,j82tlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j82tlu/vp_debate_one_part_that_really_stuck_with_me_on/,95,1602291751.0,"I was watching a rerun of  the VP debate yesterday (I know I‚Äôm late) and one line (I guess one part) that really stuck with me about the difference between Democrats and Republicans. 

I forget what exactly was said but Harris was berating Pence for not social distancing / wearing masks / etc. Pence‚Äôs reply really stuck with me because it was along the lines of ‚ÄúYou want to tell people what to do, we trust the American people are smart enough to think for themselves‚Äù

And that line really really stuck with me. I came here from Russia years ago and while I was born after the iron curtain fell, my parents weren‚Äôt so lucky. So many stories about ‚Äúknowing a guy‚Äù, countless instances of ‚Äúback door favors‚Äù

These aren‚Äôt evil people, just regular folks trying to get by (grandma was a teacher, gramps was an engineer in a factory). All this shit they had to do, was because the fucking government made regular life impossible.  To me even I hate authority on that level, I just hate people telling me what to do because I feel like ‚Äúhey man do you think I‚Äôm dumb ‚Äú

Democrats seem to be in this backslide or more and more regulations and I saw it first hand on a recent trip to Cali. While I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, the whole place just felt ‚ÄúOver regulated‚Äù, which is a real fucking shame because it‚Äôs gorgeous there. 

Republicans on the other hand are more keen on stepping back and building a solid foundation for you to go off of. I don‚Äôt need the government doing everything for me, just please give me the basics and I got it from here. 

I feel like Pence‚Äôs comment is a complete reflection of this difference in ideas. I don‚Äôt agree with everything the Republicans do but one thing I am 100% on board with is the notion of ‚Äúhey we‚Äôre just going to leave you the fuck alone‚Äù

Edit: Thanks for the pin mods.

Edit 2: Found a good opinion piece from the LA Times that illustrates the ‚Äúover regulation‚Äù in Cali very well, particularly when it comes to housing https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-broughel-hamilton-overregulation-housing-california-20190703-story.html",new,Republican

I still dont know a diplomatic way of responding to ""all western religion is built on genocide"" I heard this one today attached to ""and if you choose to put yourself in with those, youre just as bad"" and so far my best give back is ""guilt by association is a fallacy, but good try."" 

This is one of those things which have such ample examples that I start drawing blanks on listing them out because my brain doesnt know which mental gymnast flip to make on account of having too many possible directions. If you experience any of these manufactured activist quips commonly enough, please share it so we can archive them and know what absurdities to expect (and I know it's mostly repeated predictability, but every other few progressives I run across I end up getting something *so* off the wall that my political repertoire hasnt stretched and warmed up for it. I doubt Im alone in that idea.) Thanks. That mentality is so bizarre to me, I get a sort of archeological urge to study it.",new,Republican

America doesn't deserve to see our two potential presidents looking at computer screens with candidates potentially having written down answers to topics on paper right in-front of them.

I applaud President Trump for not wanting to do a virtual debate. I think he should say take all precautions you need to, but have the debate in-person. A virtual debate is a fraud.

If Biden was so far ahead as almost every major news outlet claims:

Why is Biden going to Minnesota?

Why is he campaigning at all if he's winning the electoral college?

Why is Biden going to Pennsylvania so much?

Why is Biden not touting he's winning?

Why do Harris and Biden look so defensive when pressed?

Why is Biden suddenly campaigning in-person and knocking on doors if he is ahead?

The clear answer to me is they're not doing well in their internal polls and it shows. I think Pence's response that 2 million people could've died if they hadn't shut the economy down or blocked travel from China and comparing Biden's actions on swine flu to this virus was a great answer when he was asked about coronavirus last night.",new,Republican

-2020 vice presidential debate. 10/17/2020

I sit here and type with giddy enjoyment. I just watched the 2020 vice presidential debate, and I could not be more pleased with the performance. Right out of the gate Mike Pence seemed to be an ordinary candidate. Someone who is an expert at appealing to emotion and unrelated topics. At first, I was disappointed; I did not know anything about Mike Pence before this debate. However, after the first few questions I quickly learned all about this candidates‚Äô character. He was sharp and precise but also knew how to tug on your heart strings. He was almost impulsive in the way he gave pleasantries to both the moderator and Kamala Harris. Event when he was arguing he kept his dignity and respect for the platform. 

Kamala, on the other hand, had no respect for her counterpart. At every chance she struck at even the smallest kinks in Pence‚Äôs armor. Whenever she spoke, she had an air of arrogance and pride. Instead of addressing the questions she simply rambled, changed the topic, or attacked her opponents‚Äô character. From time to time she began to give an intelligible response, but it inevitably faded into societally pleasing nonsense. She had no grip on morals or plans; her campaign hangs in the explosion of people who are willfully ignorant to the far left‚Äôs rhetoric. For once in America we are recognizing what the left truly is. They are nothing but a band of tyrannical masters of sophistry, who seek nothing but control of our great constitutional republic. 

Simply put, this is not an election about race, economy, or environment. This election is about our constitutional republic‚Ä¶or their rendition of it. Heed my warnings, they will not be kind to your freedoms. At first everything will seem good. The social activism groups will come together and praise the presidency. The Media will tell great tales of vast social justice, peace, and economic prosperity. This, however, will not last long. Using the corona virus, they will begin to infringe on your rights beyond what was ever thought possible by the original constitution. They will start to morph the very fabric of our constitutional republic. Things will fall apart, and power always comes in the place of vulnerability. Soon we will be just another example of why socialism never works‚Ä¶..

Why Biden Is In Trouble,7,j71tt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j71tt0/why_biden_is_in_trouble/,8,1602141742.0,"This is a little long but I wanted to just try to put some of the fears we all have had about this election aside. 

I know we've all been worried about mail in balloting and we've all seen CNN, NBC, Fox polls all claiming Biden has an insurmountable lead. Here's why this isn't such as issue as you might think. There have been five to five and a half ballots already returned or people that have voted early. We know Democrat voters are more likely to vote by mail but at least some of those votes are for Trump.

In 2016, Hillary received almost 66 million votes compared to Trump at 63 million. As one other person has said on a comment I read, Biden probably needs at least 16 million ballots for him in by the end of this month since a lot of his voters will vote by mail. Also, Democrat mayors in the midwestern states, a couple Democrat congressman from state legislatures like Ohio, and the governor of Puerto Rico backing Trump - that means he likely has even more support than he did four years ago. In addition, he also has the police and lawn enforcement unions backing him and will probably win a lot of the hispanic/latino vote in Florida that come from Cuba. While there is no way he will win a majority of black voters this election, I think some of them will move to Trump because of record low unemployment and wages were rising prior to the coronavirus outbreak. Unlike 2016, Trump has a record and he has delivered on everything he said he would do.

In addition, in most of the battleground states - the Republicans have already won or will win in court on mail in balloting. Governors and judges can't just change state election law by themselves without their legislatures doing so. Except for the military that can't help when their ballots come in because they are from overseas, I think the courts will decide that ballots need to be turned in by Election Day in almost all of the states.

Furthermore, we know that most Biden voters are actually voting against Trump a lot more than for Biden. That means they are likely to vote early and get it over with prior to Election Day. I don't know what percentage of Biden votes will be in by the middle or end of this month, but if Biden doesn't get a total of more than 66 million votes, it's hard to see him prevailing. The two polls that were right in 2016 (IBD and Tralfalgar) have Trump doing really well. Yes, Biden has raised a lot of money but it's not overwhelming and as we saw in 2016, money doesn't always buy elections.

If Biden had a lead, don't you think he would be going around the country touting it like Hillary did or staying in his basement? He's not doing that now - all of a sudden he's doing in person events, knocking on doors, and visiting battleground states (all of which he said was dangerous for Trump to do because of the virus). That is not what a campaign does that thinks they have this election in the bag. Internal polling is much more reliable and we can infer who's leading by how the Biden campaign is acting. Biden is going to Minnesota and Pennsylvania the most - both states the media has all but declared to be for Biden this election. I think Trump is doing much better in all the battleground states (maybe even New Hampshire) than everyone thinks.

I doubt the coronavirus takes much votes away from Trump honestly just because Trump voters tend to look at the overall picture and see what a Biden presidency could do to the economy, the Supreme Court... In addition, Biden has been seen in his CNN and NBC town halls and around people not wearing a mask and at times not social distancing. That is all what his campaign is about essentially - wearing a mask. 

My point is - don't freak out. You can do something right now to help the Trump campaign - go to [https://www.donaldjtrump.com](https://www.donaldjtrump.com) and donate right now. If you live in a battleground state, donate to the GOP in Pennsylvania, Nevada, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, New Hampshire, Ohio, and maybe even North Carolina just to ensure we win that state. Beyond that, enthusiasm is on our side. Historically, the candidate that is only against the other like Biden is does not win.

Make sure you vote, make sure your friends and family are registered, and make sure they vote to reelect the President on November 3rd! Trump just needs to emphasize that we have treatments for this virus now and we are increasing the survival rate for covid. We can't bring back any lives lost from covid but if the president says we are doing this in honor of them and at the same time touts a vaccine coming early next year or late this year, I think he wins.",new,Republican

A trans conservative view on trans rights.,5,j6krj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j6krj8/a_trans_conservative_view_on_trans_rights/,8,1602074897.0,"Trans conservatives view on being trans.
First let me introduce myself to this sub reddit. I‚Äôm trans and politically consider myself to be a conservative. It‚Äôs not the easiest balance however lol. I debated back and forth about doing this and just kept pushing it off. However I‚Äôm really curious to see peoples responses. I‚Äôm starting hrt soon and I don‚Äôt Pass yet (caterpillar) 

Why am I doing this? When you tell someone your trans they automatically think that you‚Äôre a liberal democrat. However I‚Äôm actually pro gun rights, pro life, and I believe in our need to strengthen the US economy. I vote Republican. The main reason however that I‚Äôm doing this is because I can't seem to pin point the exact republican view on being trans.

I will now lay out my beliefs on trans rights from a trans conservative perspective in full detail. Also I‚Äôm a trans woman so a lot of what I write will be from that perspective.

Terms:

HRT (hormone replacement therapy) HRT changes a person‚Äôs body fat placement hair growth muscle growth and skin smoothing based on if your taking estrogen or testosterone.

Pre-OP (before bottom surgery) someone who as the genitals of their sex

Post-OP (after bottom surgery) someone who as surgery in order to have the genitals of the sex they wish to be.

Passing: someone who looks exactly like the opposite gender. Basically it‚Äôs a trans person who passes as their preferred gender

What‚Äôs it like being trans?
It‚Äôs not easy to explain but I‚Äôll try my best. Imagine that when you look in the mirror you feel like thiers something off. You hate your body but you don‚Äôt know why. You may look very attractive and yet you feel like the ugliest scum of the earth. Also imagine that when you hang out with your friends and an attractive person walks by and everyone is discussing about how much they wished they were dating that person all you can think about is being that person.

For me personally I also hate my height. I‚Äôm over 6 feet tall.  Whenever I complaim about feeling like a monster all my friends reassure me that they are jealous of my height. I however would do anything to be under six feet tall. I want to be a cute small girl and knowing how that‚Äôs impossible causes me immense distress.

Is being trans a mental illness?
The cause of being trans is Gender dysphoria which is a mental illness. I can honestly say it sucks hating the body you‚Äôre born in.

What‚Äôs the cure?
To transition into the gender your brain tells you that you should be. I can honestly say that I feel pure joy when I do things as a girl even if they are small things. The kind of pure joy I feel when I do things as a girl is comparable to the pure joy I felt as a kid going to Disney.

Do I have to treat a trans woman as a woman and a trans man as a man?

If someone asks you to call them a girl or a guy I think that the nice thing to do is to call them she/her or he/him but I also understand that you are under no obligation to do so and I don‚Äôt think we should get upset if someone refuses to do so. That being said I have no problem with someone not feeling comfortable treating me as a girl if I looked like a guy but if I passed I would feel like the person is only doing it to be rude and they would lose my respect.

Should a trans person be allowed to change their sex on their birth certificate?

Yes if they are post-OP. In order to get bottom surgery you have to have been on hrt for two years. By this time you have many of the secondary sex characteristics as your counter part. If you also get bottom surgery on top of that I do believe that you should change the sex on your documents. Most conservative states agree with me on this.

Should a trans person use the opposite gender bathroom?

You should use the bathroom of the sex on your birth certificate. So if they get the birth certificate changed then yes. Before that no.

I‚Äôm attracted to someone who is trans am I gay?

This depends on how well they pass. A trans woman who has been on hrt for several years has curves boobs and all the other secondary sex characteristics of a female. So no if they pass your not gay.

I found out someone was trans so I ended our relationship with them was that wrong?

Yes. If they were a good person and you loved them then I do think it‚Äôs pretty shitty to end things because they were once a guy or girl. However there are aspects that I fully understand. If they are pre-op and that makes you uncomfortable I understand ending things. Also if you want kids a trans woman can‚Äôt get pregnant. Adoption is always an option but some people really desire to have their own biological kids. So I also understand ending things for that reason. Although thanks to some new research it may be possible in the future for a trans woman to give birth. Basically the only reason I would think you‚Äôre a shitty person would be if your only reason to end things was because who they were in the past.

Should a trans woman compete in womans sports?
No. Even though hrt decreases muscle size (that‚Äôs the reason why a trans woman can‚Äôt compete in mens sports. Also proof that men are naturally stronger than woman.) It doesn‚Äôt change other things like height. For example on hrt I may have the muscle mass of a woman but I would still be over 6 feet tall. I would have an unfair advantage. Trans women shouldn‚Äôt compete in mens or womans sports. You can still live an active life without being into competitive sports.

When should a trans person be allowed to transition?

18 is when a person should be allowed to transition. I know a lot of trans people wish they could have transitioned as a kid. I am also one of those trans people. That being said it‚Äôs very hard to determine if someone is suffering from gender dysphoria at that young of an age. I do think that if a therapist is involved and it is fully explored it can be possible for someone to transition before 18 but only with parental permission from both parents.

I ultimately view being trans as being a caterpillar trying to be a butterfly. I don‚Äôt think someone who is a caterpillar should be treated as a butterfly. However they will get their eventually and then they should be treated differently. Even if becoming a butterfly is impossible and you can only become a moth your still not the caterpillar you once where. 

Can a trans woman or man truly become a man or woman?

No. It‚Äôs impossible to change yourself to be exactly like the opposite gender. Still a trans person who passes should be treated as the gender they are trying to achieve.

Why are most trans people upset by these beliefs?
As you can tell I put a large emphasis on passing and medical transition. However a lot of trans people believe that none passing trans people with no medical intervention should be treated as their gender of choice. I disagree.

Are you a Satanist?

A lot of people associate being trans with being satanic I honestly don‚Äôt know why. I believe in God and I am strongly pro religious freedom. I don‚Äôt prescribe to a specific religion. I‚Äôve been told a lot that being trans is a sin which keeps me away from prescribing to a specific religion. I don‚Äôt believe that being trans is inherently wrong.

I've basically made all these beliefs myself. I tried to find out what conservative opinions where on being trans but I usually just found negative news articles or girl dick jokes. I think more trans people would vote Republican if they knew the exact Republican stance.

Please tell me your thoughts and feel free to ask me questions I‚Äôll try my best to answer them whenever I get a chance. I‚Äôm interested to know how everyone here views being trans. Also if you didn‚Äôt hold an opinion before I hope that I caused you to give this subject some thought.

I don‚Äôt start political arguments or discussions with people but if the topic is ever brought up I politely defend my stance and respect the liberal opinion. 

I am from a dominantly law enforcement and military family. Nearly every man in my lineage has been deployed or is a police officer. So naturally, in the past few months I have tried to shed light on all the amazing things police and military do for us. Because they have gotten HORRIBLY disrespected. 

One of my best friends and I went to a blue lives rally. Posted about it on Instagram. Did not engage with liberals. But lo and behold, within 48 hours the post accumulates 1,500 comments. Many of them defending our support for the police, the others... accusing us of being racist, white supremacists, that support a ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù system built on systemic racism. 

Many disrespectful comments. It bothers some liberals so much that other people can have an opinion. I gracefully and respectfully explained the correct statistic. I‚Äôm not even old enough to vote, but I am old enough to say if you can‚Äôt respect someone‚Äôs views, you are not mature enough to engage in an argument. 

I don‚Äôt need hundreds of people telling me I‚Äôm racist for supporting the 800,000 men and women in blue that are constantly putting their lives on the line. My dad told me, ‚Äúthis election is going to determine the rest of your life for you.‚Äù And I never believed it more than in the past few days. The left is becoming radical, and the media has put them on such a pedestal that they think it‚Äôs ok to attack the other side of the aisle because they disagree. 

For any adults in this: My generation is going to ruin the whole country if Biden is elected. Gen Z is the most judgemental, intolerant, radical leftist generation to ever live in America. Take my word for it. I‚Äôm experiencing it first hand. It‚Äôs truly terrifying. America is THE BEST country in the world and no one can change my mind. But we have to keep it great.

To anyone on the fence about Trump, anyone thinking about sitting this one out, any liberal lurkers here looking for a different point of view. Here's why I voted for Donald J. Trump and you should too.

Washington has failed everyday Americans for decades. The establishment cares only about the interest of lobbyists. Most politicians see a significant increase in net worth after becoming a politician. It's often thrown around that Trump became President to serve his own financial interests. [But Donald Trump has lost over 30% of his net worth since becoming President, more than $1 billion.](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/trump-has-lost-1-billion-personal-wealth-running-president-n916221) Trump is a billionaire, he's an old man, he could have retired in peace and luxury, but he didn't. He took on the most stressful job in the world, and sacrificed immensely to do so. If that doesn't say something about his character, I don't know what does.

They say he's a warmonger, but he is the first President since Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) to not get America involved in a new armed conflict. He has drawn down troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has averted conflicts with Venezuela and Iran. He has helped negotiate peace deals between North and South Korea, Serbia and Kosovo, and Israel and several Arab states, earning him three nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. [Due to his domestic policies, the US has now become the largest producer of oil in the world, and thus our dependence on the Middle East is no longer.](https://money.cnn.com/2018/09/12/investing/us-oil-production-russia-saudi-arabia/index.html)

He has done this all the while going after America's enemies, killing Baghdadi and Soleimani, two of the most wanted terrorists in the world. He stepped up the bombing campaign against ISIS and attacked Syria for crossing the Red Line In The Sand**‚Ñ¢** that his predecessor set (and never enforced). He has brought back the tried and true strategy of deterrence through strength, not appeasement, having done away with the Iran nuclear deal (that unfroze billions of dollars of Iran's assets on the promise not to build nuclear weapons).

[He has also negotiated the release of hostages from North Korea, Iran, and the Taliban.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/rnc-2020-trump-appears-hostages-he-helped-bring-home-u-n1237960) [He has stepped up the war on human trafficking](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/31/politics/donald-trump-combat-human-trafficking/index.html) leading to thousands of children being rescued over the past four years. He implemented the Right to Try, allowing terminal patients to skip the red tape for experimental treatments. [He took on Big Pharma and has worked to reduce prescription drug prices.](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/2020/08/11/why_big_pharma_is_fighting_trump_over_cheap_drugs_519738.html#!)

They say he's a sellout. But he has implemented policies that directly help the average American. He cut taxes for all tax brackets and all sizes of business, leading to the lowest unemployment rates for women, Hispanics, and blacks in history. [For the first time in decades, the average worker saw an increase in real wage growth.](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/are-wages-rising-or-flat/) His policies led to the greatest bull market the US has ever seen. He passed the USMCA trade agreement, replacing NAFTA, [something that achieved overwhelmingly bipartisan support.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/12/19/21013178/usmca-trade-deal-passes-house-vote-approve-bipartisan-nafta-trump)

And why do people think he's a bad man? Everything I just mentioned is true and verifiable. They say he's a Russian puppet, but he was not the President that allowed Russia to waltz into Ukraine and Syria and take what they wanted (Thanks Obama). Trump has now been cleared twice of the 'Russian collusion' narrative, once by Robert Mueller, and once by a bipartisan Senate investigation.

Donald Trump became the 3rd President to be impeached, out of 45 Presidents in 230 years. [He was the first to be impeached without actually having a crime cited against him.](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/dec/12/paul-gigot/donald-trump-would-be-first-us-president-impeached/) Interesting how the Democrats no longer bring up his impeachment...

Let us not forget the Kavanaugh confirmation, and how the Democrats treated a man who had absolutely zero evidence or reason against him.

People blame him for the coronavirus pandemic, [when a significant amount of deaths come from nursing homes in Democratic states with Democratic governors, that ordered sick nursing home patients to stay in the homes](https://www.newsmax.com/us/house-oversight-elderly-vulnerable/2020/06/15/id/972323/).

[Joe Biden called Trump's travel ban fear mongering and xenophobic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAdzW-mRKTk). [Nancy Pelosi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZBFUA0JjFk)  encouraged Americans to gather in China Town to rebuke Trump's ""xenophobia"" AFTER the travel ban from China. Let us not forget, Trump imposed the travel ban while [the WHO was saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission](https://www.businessinsider.com/who-no-transmission-coronavirus-tweet-was-to-appease-china-guardian-2020-4?op=1) and [Dr. Fauci was saying there was nothing to worry about](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqg2kQDlPKw).

And who is the alternative? Joe Biden, a man who has been in DC for 47 years, is responsible for the 1994 crime bill that put a generation of black men behind bars (the opposite of [President Trump's First Step Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Step_Act), allowing a pathway for non-violent drug offenders to be released with a fresh start). Joe Biden, a man with [a history of racist comments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TJpnGCHtnA) and [touching little girls inappropriately](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4PLSPvJ9BY). Joe Biden, Vice President to the first black President, who chose to do nothing about systemic racism for 8 years (because it only exists when they're not the ones in power, right?).

The Democrats are a party that want to eliminate the electoral college, pack the Supreme Court, make Puerto Rico and Washington DC a state to pack the House and Senate with more Democrats (in the case of DC, against the founding father's wishes, but I guess dying wishes only matter when coming form Democrats). They want to defund the police, restrict your Second Amendment right, open the borders, and send out hundreds of millions of blank ballots. Do these sound like the policies of people who are looking out for *you*? Or the policies of a party that is looking our for *themselves*?

We live in a world where black is white, up is down, war is peace, freedom is slavery, and ignorance is strength. Kyle Rittenhouse is apparently a murdering white supremacist, despite no evidence of him being a white supremacist [and just needing to watch the video to see it was clear as day self defense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NSU9ZvnudFE).

Apparently White Supremacists are the greatest threat to this country. Antifa and BLM? The groups that riot, beat, loot, murder and burn stuff down? Yeah, according to Democrats they're no problem.

Liberals have come to be driven by blind hate. The same way the Bolsheviks were, the same way the Nazis were, the same way the Khmer Rouge were, the same way the Chinese Communist Party were. **No one ended up on the wrong side of history by thinking they were the bad guys.** They all thought they were righteous and justified.

And that is where we are at. The left has been driven up into such a blind rage, [driven by fake news and pure propaganda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_ilHJOkY4k), that they are willing to let things escalate.

And that is why we must vote for Donald J. Trump. He is not perfect. He is not a god. But he has consistently done what is best for this country.

And remember, it's okay to be in the ideological minority. You know who was one of the first Presidents to win the electoral college but lose the popular vote? [Our party's first President, Abraham Lincoln.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1860_United_States_presidential_election) If we instead opted for a ranked popular vote, he would have never become President and a Southern Democrat would have won. And I'm sure we're all glad that that man became President.

If this does not convince you, I don't know what will.

God bless.

If you could share this with friends, family, people unsure about Trump, it would be greatly appreciated. I put a lot into this. Not **A LOT** but enough to be sad if no one ever sees it. Cheers.",controversial,Republican

So you think that Trump is showing his Nazi tendencies and there's stormtroopers on the streets of Portland. Here's something that needs to be said:,19,hy0voa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/hy0voa/so_you_think_that_trump_is_showing_his_nazi/,90,1595767583.0,"For as long as I can really REMEMBER Republican Presidents (Reagan) ...the left has called them **Nazis.**

When Trump was elected, you said he was a *wanna be dictator.*  You said he was going to find a way to declare martial law and be President forever.  Some of you who say and said this were the same people who scoffed and (rightfully) laughed when some on the right claimed that Obama would do this.

So ... what have we seen in the USA since Trump was elected?  A constant invective of leftist pap from the commie boot-licking media.

Attempts to remove him from office.  Again and again.  

Claims that detention centers for illegal immigrants that have existed under numerous Presidents are now ""Nazi concentration camps.""

And see, we had a national emergency in Covid 19.  If he was going to declare martial law and overstep, that was the *perfect* opportunity to do it.  ""Why isn't he doing more,"" you said.  Because it is the right and responsibility of the state governors to deal with their respective states.  But he DID OFFER FEDERAL help to those who needed and requested it.

Covid did NOT make Trump into a tyrant.

So what came next?  Camera footage of the George Floyd arrest.

Most of America was horrified and agreed that the police bore responsibility for misuse of force ... (even though, apparently, that particular neck hold was accepted as a restraint method for someone resisting in a *number* of different states.)

We were fairly united in condemning that.

But then the left, BLM and Antifa took the opportunity to encourage and promote widespread destruction across the USA.  Destruction that didn't just ""burn property""...(though that in itself IS BAD) but took the lives of people and police and ruined businesses and created an environment that gave rise to a part of Washington state trying to declare itself to be a totally DIFFERENT autonomous country until they figured out that they couldn't do that (legally) and renamed themselves to a ""protest"" zone.  And people died there.

For days we watched as people tried to break down barriers around the White House.  The DC government appears to have abdicated their responsibility to keep the peace and seemed to stand down as 60 secret service agents were injured over the course of days of attacks against the White House and ***you thought it was funny*** that they might have been concerned enough at one point to put the President in the bunker.  You damned fools who think attacking the White House was good?  You have NO IDEA the defenses unconventional and otherwise that the White House has to debilitate your ass quickly.  These idiots legitimately thought that they were going to storm the White House and you acted like it was their right to do it because they were really mad about George Floyd.

**...a man who was killed in a Democrat run state in a democrat run city.**

We gathered what this was all about very quickly...and we watched ALL the livestreams of the protesting.  Yeah...we saw the one where the cop pulled a gun on a guy...and we ALSO KNOW that it happened because someone came up behind a police supervisor with a brick and smashed him over the head with it.

You ignored the destruction and riots in favor of a narrative of blaming the cops for reacting to SENSELESS riots.  Cops that were in mostly liberal cities run by Democrats.  Riot cops using riot techniques responded to riots and you did surprised Pikachu face.

It's been months now with this lawlessness happening and Trump has repeatedly told Democrat governments to get it under control.

But your Democrat governments failed you.  They decided that destruction of businesses sometimes created over the lifetime of black owners who cried in the streets after they were looted and burned...that lives lost..that packs roaming the streets bent on violence and anarchy... all of these were ACCEPTABLE...

...because it was making the President look bad.

He showed AMAZING restraint.  60 secret service members were injured and a church torched before Barr said that the perimeter around the White House should be moved back.

Months of violent protests.  Months.

And your Democrat leaders let you stew in it.  They abandoned their civilians and turned on their police.  You need to understand that they REFUSED to act appropriately and put many of you in real danger of harm because its an election year and these riots are ""bad for Trump.""

If it seemed like there was no one to protect you... it's because there was not...except the FEDERAL government and the governors kept telling Trump, ""Don't you dare.""  They refused to protect you and when Trump said, ""You need to restore order or I'm going to have to help your citizens..."" they said, ""Don't you dare.""

And he didn't dare.  He didn't declare martial law.  

He repeatedly asked the Democrat governments to stop the violence and protect the citizens.

And they didn't.  Because the destruction and bloodshed was acceptable because it made Trump look bad.  And the media carried their water.  There were not stories about how Democrat cities were failing to maintain law and order...there were stories about how these ""protests"" were justified.

...maybe they think it made Trump look weak... maybe they were trying to bait Trump into sending in help so that they could scream that he was a Nazi.

These protests are ""against fascism and police brutality"" you say!

***...So why the hell is the worst of it in Portland?***

Does Portland have a fascist government?  WTF are you even protesting there?  Portland is ""weird"".  Portland is antifa central.  You little shits harass innocent motorists there and the cops stand down.  Portland's NOT a fascist city.  But the trained Marxists of BLM and the violent anti-capitalist revolutionaries of antifa burned down the police union building, locked cops in a building and tried to burn it and are trying to burn a federal building.

**So now y'all got some federal attention.  And you've clutched your pearls to yell, ""Brownshirts!""**  

No... the BROWNSHIRTS are you little commie and otherwise criminal miscreants who have been making the streets unsafe across the USA for months.

MY GAWD...you called the Tea Party ""un-american terrorists""...but if they had pulled a QUARTER of the shit y'all have pulled...you would have had a POINT.

They pulled NONE OF IT.

**YOU ARE DOMESTIC TERRORISTS.**

You got naked women and alleged grandmas out there now for your human shield.  Are kids next?

And it's about time someone dealt with your FEDERAL crimes because your inept leftist leaders have put innocents in the way of violence over POLITICS.

Your cause is no longer just.

You need to stop doing violence.

Cowardly democrat leaders need to stop LETTING you get away with it.

Now the feds are in Portland.

**""They are unmarked brownshirts!""**

They ARE marked, but they don't look like your local officers, because they aren't. You have shown the kind of harm you mean to do to police who are identified.  You have already killed MARKED police officers.

When the unmarked mommy van pulls up and arrests you, I'm not thinking ""Fascism has come to America.""

I'm thinking, ""It's about FUCKING time.""

You complained about ""armed militias"" protesting the covid shutdown, [but yesterday an armed black militia member ""accidentally"" discharged a weapon and shot other protestors.](https://abcnews.go.com/US/members-armed-militia-shot-breonna-taylor-protest/story?id=71990031)

And you have the nerve to try to insist that we need to join you now in your protest because Trump has federal marshals on the streets?  Not just no...but HELL NO.

2. I voted Democrat because I believe the government will do a better job of spending the money I earn than I would.

3. I voted Democrat because Freedom of Speech is fine as long as nobody is offended by it.

4. I voted Democrat because I'm way too irresponsible to own a gun, and I know that my local police are all I need to protect me from murderers and thieves.

5. I voted Democrat because I believe that people who can't tell us if it will rain on Friday can tell us that the polar ice caps will melt away in ten years if I don't start driving a Prius.

6. I voted Democrat because I'm not concerned about millions of babies being aborted so long as we keep all death row inmates alive.

7. I voted Democrat because I think illegal aliens have a right to free health care, education, and Social Security benefits, and we should take away the social security from those who paid into it.

8. I voted Democrat because I believe that business should not be allowed to make profits for themselves. They need to break even and give the rest away to the government for redistribution as the Democrats see fit.

9. I voted Democrat because I believe liberal judges need to rewrite the Constitution every few days to suit some fringe kooks who would never get their agendas past the voters.

10.I voted Democrat because I think that it's better to pay billions to people who hate us for their oil, but not drill our own because it might upset some endangered beetle, gopher or fish.

My Issues with the Gay Rights movement,0,xb14i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/xb14i/my_issues_with_the_gay_rights_movement/,98,1343527934.0,"First of all I want to say I am positing this here rather then /r/politics because I thik I more likely to get the discussion I want here then the obama zombie downvotes I would get there. Second I'm not going to start off saying weather or not I support gay marriage because I'm sick of people going ""I support gay marriage but..."" because they are afraid of the ridiculous reaction if they don't post that. You should be able to tell from what I'm writing.

First off, lets get one thing out of the way, Being gay has one big component and that is gay sex, if you don't have gay sex, you are just attracted to the same gender as yourself. I think a lot of people discount the ACT of gay sex in their discussions. It seems that it has been decreed as an ACTION that cannot be judged, which I find kind of ridiculous, but I will bring this point up again when I get to gay marriage.

Gay Kids are on the Front Line
I think the Gay Rights movement has put gay kids on the front line. Admittedly I think this would also happen without the gay rights movement, but I don't think the gay rights movement tries to shield gay kids, because it is not in their best political interest. There is a lot of emphasis put on coming out and being out and proud, and I think that is detrimental to some kids who just want to get through high school and move on to a community where they won't be treated like crap because they are the only ones who are different. I can see in some sense it may be a good idea to expose highschoolers to different sexualities early on for the sake of tolerance, but I think in most cases kids will be dicks until they mellow out around the age they get in to college. This is just a maturity thing. So in some cases there is no good reason for these ay kids to come out until college when there is a local community they can turn to. The counter point to this may be that kid who killed himself after his roommate tried to watch him having sex through a web cam. Perhaps if the room mate had been exposed to more gay people early on he wouldn't have done such a thing. Or he was just a dick who didn't like his room mate and would have tried to web cam him even if he brought a girl in to the room.

The Gay Hissy Fit
This is currently going on with Chick-Fil-A. When the country didn't overnight go ""Oh ok same sex marriage"" it seems a lot of people had really bad over the top reactions. Same Sex marriage is a HUGE social change. Marriage has mainly been between a man and a woman. Sure it has also mainly been a property transaction, a political move, a way to consolidate power, but even in those cases, it was between a man and a woman. (There is apparently some evidence of the very early church doing some kind of consecration of a same sex relationship, but it was more or less declaring the people to be brothers, not married) This isn't going to chance over night. There is nothing in the constitution about Same sex marriage because when you suggested to someone back then that two men might want to marry eachother, they would have looked at you funny. It was so obvious they they figured they didn't need to add anything about it. No, they didn't even figure. The over reactions to a differing opinion on the mater do not help the movement and in fact hurt it because it sets up a ""with us or against us"" situation. I think the issue of same sex marriage will be sorted out mainly with time, telling me I'm awful because I like Chick-Fil-A isn't going to help. The violent reactions to the people that supported Prop 8 probably just justified their donations in their eyes.

Same Sex Marriage
I just want to try and spell out what I think the problem people have with same sex marriage. The biblical passage basically point out that the ACT of gay sex is wrong. So people who believe it find gay sex to be immoral. Basically if you don't think gay sex is immoral you should have no problem with same sex marriage, plain and simple. However if you do find it immoral, you are going to have an issue with an official recognition of a relationship where that action occurs because it is forcing something on you, from your perspective. This is the only example I could think up that works I think. So some people like Dominant submissive sexual situations, maybe they take it so far that s that s lives as a slave with D. In their home s is D's slave. D and s decide that they want the world to treat them how they act inside their home, so they go to court and say they want a slave marriage where s is officially declared the slave of D, and s is officially property. A judge finally goes, well you are two consenting adults, and if s really wants it I will declare that s if officially property that belongs to D. So now everybody has to treat s as property, if s works a job his/her wages have to go in to Ds account because s is property and can't have a bank account, if s is seen driving around without D, the police have to bring s back to Ds house and so on and so forth. Some people might find that they don't want to do this because they think treating people as property as wrong and don't want the courts to tell them ""too bad, this is what they want"" so they then go ahead and try to make Slave marriage illegal. I'm pretty sure it breaks down because the Constitution expressly forbids slavery, but you get the idea. I think there is a lot of dicussion that doesn't happen because the gay rights movement just labels people as bigots and full of hate and that just hardens their hearts against gay rights and gay families. I don't have a solution for what they should be doing, but I don't certain things are working.

**This subreddit is for Republicans.**

**Donald Trump is the Republican candidate for President.**

Now we suddenly have lots of ""life long Republicans"" who have NEVER posted here before thinking that they have a right to come and tell people not to vote for the Republican candidate for President who is the current Republican President.

Look ... if you want to battle conservatives/Republicans ... start your own subreddit for it.  If you cannot find Republicans to argue with on reddit, think about why you might have chased them out of all the places they might post.

**But don't come HERE and think that you can push Democrat talking points or advocate for Democrats.  We WILL show you the door.**

I grew up a Rush Baby so my parents were strictly conservative and dismissed anything that wasn't. So as you can imagine I was the same way. Then I started growing up and seeing both sides of the story instead of just seeing democrats as ""tree-loving, hippie, potheads"". So I started questioning my politics and after hearing some level headed democrats instead of dismissing them as mini Al Gores, I started to see everything clearer. I still agree with the republican policies (POLICIES-not candidates, POLICIES) like the pro life, small government, etc. The only thing I don't agree with is their stand on gay marriage. I've been seeing some of the republican candidates lately and they really scare me. I feel like they're all wishy-washy, spineless, and it pisses me off when I see them changing their politics just to be more politically correct and ""please"" a wider variety of people. Take Michelle Bachmann for example. In an interview a few years earlier when she wasn't in the run for the presidency, she was super radical with her views on abortion (""No. No. No.""). And I admired that she was so stuck in her ways! It was nice-no, refreshing- to see someone in Washington take such a tough, for lack of a better word, stance on the issue. But now in an earlier interview she puts off as more lenient and almost forgiving on her stance (""Well, I mean in certain cases I GUESS abortion is OKAY...""). Seriously?! Sorry it's so long, I just want to see if anyone out there can help me restore my faith in the GOP (and Rush Limbaugh). ",controversial,Republican

You can no longer hear opposing viewpoints on /r/politics because too many people use the arrows as ""I agree"" and ""I disagree"".   Over there the most generic leftist talking points are massively upvoted while anything that goes against the leftist hivemind is aggressively downvoted until it is buried.  Then the poster has negative karma on the sub and has to wait 10 minutes between comments.  They finally leave the subreddit, ensuring the liberal purity of /r/politics.  And that's why you have to come here to find different opinions.

The problem is you're bringing that same behavior with you.  When you abuse the arrows by upvoting leftist comments and downvoting mainstream Republican comments then you're only going to recreate a smaller version of /r/politics.  You're burying the very differing viewpoints you were seeking.

Therefore, until the top comments in every thread are mainstream Republican comments we will continue to ban anyone pushing a leftist narrative.  

Are you a Republican who has liberal viewpoints on one or two issues?  I suggest you focus on the other issues for the time being.

I am of the opinion, as I'm sure many people are, that the economics of the U.S. are barely, if at all, controlled by the president. There is too much intervention by too much money from outside of the government making decisions for us. This in and of itself is certainly a huge problem, but it's pretty obvious to me that a change in president will not remotely solve the issue. 

To me, the larger issues are issues of civil liberties. And just as the issue of black slaves, women's right to vote, etc. (not to belittle other great progresses made by many other groups), changed this country for the better, a woman's right to choose and gay marriage are next on the list of great things we can accomplish.

And as usual, we are far behind the other progressive countries of the world (I wouldn't even honestly call the U.S. progressive at this point).

I am tired of the hipster 'moderate Republican' line that it is a toss-up favoring Obama. Why is it considered smart to equivocate and be a contrarian against the obvious facts? I read news from Drudge and if the polls were adjusted to show reasonable republican turnout levels (not Obama-2008 democrat vs republican turnout levels) we would be leading those polls in many important swing states. Romney will also win the popular vote. There are countless sources aggregated on Drudge that analyze this.

The American people should stand up to the Obama administration's condemnation of speech that *they* deem to be offensive.,0,100po4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/100po4/the_american_people_should_stand_up_to_the_obama/,54,1347914385.0,"I am stunned and disgusted that this administration has repeatedly condemned an instance of free speech in order to appease and quell extremist rioters. Our ambassador, Susan Rice, would not even broach the issue of free speech on the Sunday shows; it was simply decided at the highest levels that somehow the US was being consistent and wise to join angry Muslims in their displeasure at this video.

If this is acceptable to Americans, we have effectively surrendered free speech. We can offend eachother freely, but not the scary Islamists. Thank you, President Obama, for making the first amendment officially meaningless.",controversial,Republican

Question for the Republicans of Reddit,0,16dpdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/16dpdd/question_for_the_republicans_of_reddit/,47,1357944215.0,"In recent months much has been discussed about gun control laws. I see, and respect, both sides of many of these issues, including concealed handguns and the constitutional right to own firearms. Yet one thing that I cannot rationalize is the staunch defense of personal ownership of automatic weapons such as the XM-15 used in the Newtown, CT shootings.

My question is, why? Why should it be an unassailable right for citizens to bear weaponry designed to give overwhelming fire superiority in a firefight? Is it simply the fear of at some point potentially needing to overthrow a tyrannical government? Or, is there a more complicated and rational reason behind this position?

"Why Romney Will Win, And It Won't Be Close",7,125cb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/125cb1/why_romney_will_win_and_it_wont_be_close/,83,1351320170.0,"History shows us that if an incumbent president can't get over the 50% mark, he's in serious trouble. The reason behind this is that undecided voters break for the challenger about 80% of the time.

The reason for this phenomenon is, everyone already knows who the incumbent is. If someone does not support the incumbent this late into the election, most of the time it's because they are unhappy with them. This is why we're seeing a break for Romney over the last couple weeks, and this is why it won't even be close on election day.

Here are some links for you to digest:

http://www.pollingreport.com/incumbent.htm
http://www.mysterypollster.com/main/2004/10/the_incumbent_r.html
http://www.mydd.com/2004/9/3/incumbent-rule-research-update

These swing states that have Obama at 45-48 where he is leading by 1 to 3 percentage points - they will very likely go Romney on election day.

How will raising taxes on the rich and wealthy hurt the economy?,2,wjmzs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/wjmzs/how_will_raising_taxes_on_the_rich_and_wealthy/,49,1342290642.0,"So it seems the end of the Bush tax cuts on the wealthy are a big deal to some people and I want to know why? Is there any evidence supporting that higher tax rates for people with high income is bad for the economy?

Everything I seem to find shows the opposite. Tax rates are relatively low compared to what they used to be. I have read that the lower tax rates lead to inflation, and does not greatly stimulate job creation like some people are claiming.

Is this something that most republicans support or is it just the minority on Fox News? I am looking for statistical and historical data that supports this claim.

Follow Up:
I just want to thank you for your answer student_of_yoshi, and I agree that there is a lack of investment capital, and I feel there is a lot of control over markets by big companies that push out small business that I don't agree with. I think there was a post on Reddit not to long ago about wireless carriers making phone technology stagnant by refusing to carry certain phones and literally causing phone companies to lose millions of dollars they invested into a product they are now not able to sell.

 I just had a talk with my friend and he gave a similar view but explained it in away that made it a little easier for me to believe.  He explained that most of the super wealthy have a lot of money invested in stock, which is Investment. So in some regard the super wealthy do create investment. It is up to smaller business to try and take advantage of the stock market to get the investment capital they need to grow.

And I want to thank everyone else for expressing their views and trying to defend them. This really was just an honest attempt to expand my horizons. It seems that in general most people don't think that a slight raise in tax will hurt economic growth, which confirms how I feel. But my argument as to why we should have a slight tax increase is to help balance the budget and lower inflation, and as people pointed out some of the best economic growth we had was during Clinton presidency, I am not sure what the factors were that made this but I feel a lot of it might have been do to the balancing of the national budget and therefor strengthening the value of the dollar. Yes cutting spending is a huge part of balancing a budget, but I feel it is only part of the solution and a whole other topic for debate.

The youngest, my 3 year old daughter, won the coloring contest and will receive a $25 gift card.

The two older kids went ""wait, no fair!  We turned ours in too, why didn't we win?""  I said, well, she had the better coloring for the contest.  Not everyone can win and the people that judge the coloring judged her the winner, so she wins.

The two other kids actually got sad here and demanded my youngest share the prize because they ""worked just as hard"" and it was only fair.  

In the background, the TV was on low and I saw Obama and Romney on TV and thought, this is exactly what this is all about.

We are turning into a country that punishes and expresses hatred to others who are successful to the point that we dismiss the millions they do pay in taxes (income, sales, luxury, capital gains) and demand more.  We list all the entitlements that people should get because Canada and Europe do it (and it is working so well in Greece, Spain and Italy)

I got mad at the kids for it.  They dismissed the win with rage and jealousy.  It was all chance that ""one of them would win"" anyway in the contest but the older two don't accept it.  Given the same opportunity and the youngest wins just caused so much anger and jealousy.  I told my wife this was what fundamentally wrong with our country.  We jealous of success rather than praising it.",controversial,Republican

In my view, Obama has implemented much of what was once the priorities of conservative think tanks. He's sided with big money over and over again in lieu of helping the middle class and the poor. He is certainly no dove, having ramped up in Afghanistan and interjected in other conflicts.

He is presiding over a recession borne of bi-partisan deregulation. Obama's response has been moderate. The debt has increased under his watch, but nothing compared to his predecessor, not to mention Ronald Reagan. 

Obama is a centrist if there ever was one. I can appreciate a conservative wanting someone more to the right in the office, but I don't understand what about his presidency has the right in such a frothy mix. Someone please explain.

I'm by no means a very versed person as far as politics are concerned, please excuse the ""well that's obvious"" questions, possibly explain it like I'm 5. 
 
 
**1:** This Jeep add thing that's been going around about Chrysler moving to china. From what I understand they are restarting their operations in China and are pushing to expand their market share in Asia, not closing up shop in the USA. Though the Republican Candidate has stated that the opposite is true. Why would one make such a bold faced fabrication? It appears to be a plea for attention. 
 
 
**2:** Why are religious beliefs held so high in politics? I'm allowed, as the country was founded, to believe what I want as far as religion is concerned. I've always wondered why the Pro-Life\Pro-Choice thing ever became a thing. I've been told by people on both sides that its either: ""Life begins at conception, there is no negotiating that, even if they don't share my beliefs"" or ""its my body, if i want to have an abortion then I should be able to in a safe and reputable establishment, not in a back alley with a coat hanger."" 
 
 
**3:** Big Government vs Small Government: what is the difference? shifting responsibility from the federal government just makes state government larger, and privatizing it makes it even worse in some cases. Things like social programs and systems for the elderly, veterans and such do help. Yes there is a ton of abuse in the systems but that would be curtailed (not solved) by reforming the systems. Not that either side can agree on how to do that. I personally don't think they should be abolished but reworked and rebuilt into a new system that actually works and helps the people that need it. 
 
 
**4:** What is the true draw of the Republican party? I've been told they are more fiscally minded, but I haven't seen anything that really fits into that category. I've seen people lord of the fact that the President has to borrow money from the reserve to keep the country running (devaluing the dollar) and that a republican wouldn't, how? 
 
 
**5:** Taxes: Cutting taxes over and over (for everyone) means the Federal Government nets less money to use. I hate paying taxes but I pay them to keep our military supplied, our infrastructure intact and pay for the social programs, that I may have to use one day. Taking home less money but having better social programs, education and other such things seems better then me going home with an extra $100 a paycheck. I've never really understood why people are so passionate about taxes, they are something that everyone has to deal with. Yes it takes money away from me, but it pays for the clerks and other people to have jobs... so I'm working so others can work. 


**Epilogue:**  
I've been tossing some thoughts around with my friends and family trying to discuss various aspects of this election. Some are met thoughtfully and are explained very well and others are just yelling matches that result in me losing faith in them. I'm not an overly religious person nor do I attend any services, but I am aware of the good that religion can do. I was raised to be tolerant of others and their beliefs, while still remembering to be me. I don't see that in the republican party, I don't see that in America much; we have moved away from the core values we have moved to ""ME"" and not ""Help others, not for gain, not for recognition, because you may need help later in life.""
 
So please take the time, I'm not too concerned with being called out, or having this post sent to the pits of hell. I'm just looking for another side to the story. 

**EDIT**

sorry needed a day to work some family things out. Answered some posts and read though everything! I see the post is getting buried but that's cool. if anyone else see's this feel free to post. I check often as I can.",controversial,Republican

One Black Liberal's take on how the right can win 2016,0,12w9du,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12w9du/one_black_liberals_take_on_how_the_right_can_win/,18,1352461068.0,"I would like to start by saying I have thoroughly enjoyed the discourse and diversity of ideas and positions I've seen following the election.  I would like to follow that with things I think repubs have missed in the last couple of elections; and ideas on how to improve.

The first thing is (I believe many has touched on this) Republicans basically stand for Old White Racists.  I think what many people do not realise is, how long peoples memories are.  We *remember* Jim Crow laws, we remember the hassles of De-Segregation, we remember redistricting and real-estate conning.  Basically the saying goes, Not all Republicans are Racists, but most Racists are Republican.

Second is the idea of the reduction of Big Government, again, if it weren't for the direct intervention of Big Government, many minority groups would still be taken advantage of.

On Fiscal Responsibility, no one on either side is fiscally conservative, but at least the liberals don't hate me because of my skin.

On Immigration; Probably the most complex issue, I work for Los Angeles Unified School District, and it's about 98% Hispanic where I am .  While I am not down for Amnesty either, anything less will lose you the block in General, all of these kids have illegal aliens in their immediate families.

On the whole self accountability thing, I would totally agree with you, and the whole personal responsibility thing, IF the starting positions were equal.  Which they are clearly not, you cannot begin to suggest that Urban School Districs have any where near the competitiveness of, suburban upper middle class Schools.

Over all I would Suggest that if Republicans want to win National Elections, they will have to basically change from a party of wealthy and white (with the exception of the south; they are poor and crazy) to a party that actually exemplifies what it says.  You believe in personal accountability? Level the playing field.  Attracting minorities?  Write and produce policies that actually benefit minority groups. 

Many people of Color Imagine what their lives would be like if they could try being white, it seems very few Conservatives imagine what it's like to be anything but white.  For example if you look over the Social Policy and ideas espoused by the right for the past 60 years, would that encourage you to vote for them?  And now if you were working class black, Hispanic or Asian.  Being poor increases the likely hood that you'll be *More* reliant on government assistance.  Why vote for the guy that puts you down and keeps you there?

I am very sorry if this post is ill-written I am not good at posting on the internet.  I tried to keep my points as to the point as possible; often times I fail.",controversial,Republican

What do you make of this Pew poll?,1,12jwgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/12jwgl/what_do_you_make_of_this_pew_poll/,17,1351946571.0,"I've been pouring through polling data for the last while because I can't wait for the election to get here. I've been trying to figure out what partisan spread is the break-even point between Romney and Obama by creating a scatter-plot (still very primitive) between a poll's partisan spread and the poll's outcome. To this point it looks like the tipping point is somewhere between D+4.5 and D+3.5 (by plotting it I can find the x-intercept where the x-axis is the partisan spread and the y-axis is the outcome difference). I ran across [this Pew poll](http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/10-29-12%20FINAL%20Political%20Release.pdf) with party affiliation that fit very nicely with what Gallup was getting in it's polls. The unweighted polling numbers are on page 16.

If you run the partisan affiliation you get 36.1 R, 28.7 I, 35.2 D. There are 50 unaccounted for likely voters who must have abstained from giving their political party, but if you use those numbers above you get an outcome of Romney by 1.65 points, and if you count independent undecideds as independents you get a 1.92 point spread with Romney just over 50% of the vote.

I wish more polls presented their unweighted numbers, but very few do. Honestly, I'm not really sure why I'm posting this. Someone mentioned wanting to see more posts that could spark discussions (and I believe this is one that can reach all members of this subreddit...even the Independents and Democrats) and were based around facts and figures rather than just sensationalism. 

The question is, given that these voters who chose not to give their party affiliation must have voted strongly for Obama (the outcome of the poll is 47-47 when looking at male-female ratio), are these individuals likely to vote in your mind? I can show or explain any math. It's just weighted averages. ",controversial,Republican

Do you see how pathetically the media is covering what reddit just did?  Almost every headline focuses on reddit banning The_Donald for ""hate speech violations.""

Chapotraphouse, which was full of leftist calls to violence is mentioned as an afterthought if at all.

And The Donald has been dead for MONTHS.  The admins killed it, installed their own mods and the posters moved to another site.  No one has been posting there.

But they wanted a headline saying that they had banned it for hate.

That's bullshit.  They didn't ban it for hate.  The banned it because they wanted that headline right now.  I've been watching every media outlet fall in line saying the same exact thing all day long.

They banned Chapo so they'd have cover to say this was unbiased.

But the actual BIG STORY is that reddit is biased now.

As you read these words from Spez I want you to remember:

""All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others.""

Spez: ""While the rule on hate protects such groups, it does not protect all groups or all forms of identity. For example, the rule does not protect groups of people who are in the majority or who promote such attacks of hate.""

One of the protected groups is illegal immigrants.

But apparently, if you are in a ""majority"" group... it's fine on reddit for people to say that you are subhuman scum.  Hate against YOU is not actionable.

What a lovely free-speech place!

And reddit wasn't transparent about that subreddits that were banned.  You got to know what a FEW of them were (***including The_Donald, natch, because they wanted THAT headline**)

But r/hatecrimehoaxes is gone.  So is r/campusconservatives?  For some reason?  And r/rightwinglgbt...

https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/hi43c3/list_of_subs_that_have_been_banned_today/

AHS and others are already sharpening their knives to come after r/conservative.  If they manage to take it down, r/republican will be next...

The reign of terror see... it doesn't ever stop.

That's why you should never START it.

Personally, I think that this is the beginning of the end of reddit.  And it's been fun.  I mean...it's also been crap for conservatives and especially mods who have been targeted for harassment by the lefty hordes.

But that's gonna be fine now.  Because they will say that we are in the majority...so we aren't protected from hate the way everyone else is protected from hate.

The Scandinavian countries have the smallest gap between the upper-low class (in the western world). They work like we (Canada) and you (US) do on a progressive taxing system, only they have a 'billionaires tax' type of thing.

Advantages (of small gap, shown by select Scandinavian countries)

* Highest life expectancy

* Lowest crime rates

* Lowest % of depression in the population

* All Scandinavian countries are among the group of Countries with the lowest infant (<5) mortality rate. (m/f) (6/6).. This group includes Canada, U.K., Switzerland and others.. (the last time I checked the US is at 8/7) *Source: Amnesty International*

* The lowest drug abuse rate (this is probably more related to legalization of most drugs... That is an entirely different argument)


**Flaws** *(oh goody the place where I shoot myself)*

To top that off, we live in Maryland, one of the most regulation-heavy states in the country. I can fully and completely understand most of the issues people have with Obama, but firearms? Is this just a case of the NRA doing what they do, or is there a genuine issue here?",controversial,Republican

Why do you hate the Chevy Volt?,4,zq4tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/zq4tj/why_do_you_hate_the_chevy_volt/,109,1347422319.0,"Why does it seem that a large percentage of the Republican party hates the Chevy Volt?  How else are we going to stop giving hundreds of billions of dollars to our enemies every year?

Please note a few points:

* Can we shelve the auto bailout from this discussion?  I am talking about the car itself, not the bailout money that may have been used to fund it.

* Can we also shelve the ""cost"" debate (i.e. GM loses $50,000 per Volt that it sells).  Toyota lost a lot on their first and second Generation Prius cars, but now the Prius is now one of their top-selling cars (and it is now very profitable).  Back in 2007 Apple spent a lot of money developing the iPhone too.

* I agree that we should drill more and have more domestic production of oil, but even if we did, others in the world would have to give money to bad countries for oil, thus keeping them strong.

The solution in my opinion is to lower demand for oil so much that its price plummets.  The day that this happens will be a good day for America.

Reasons To Not Vote Democrat,0,ih375q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/ih375q/reasons_to_not_vote_democrat/,4,1598491655.0," 

1. **The Movement To Defund And Abolish The Police:** In major cities across America there is now a movement by Democrat politicians to defund and in some cases even abolish the police. This started because of the George Floyd incident. Yes there are bad cops. But the police as an institution are good. They are the only people who stand between us and the wolves. Imagine a society without them. Who are you going to call when the stealing, murdering and raping starts?
2. **Slavery Reparations:** Slavery was a great historical injustice. I believe that there should have been some kind of financial payment to freed slaves. Sadly that didn't happen. Now there is a movement in the Democratic Party for slavery reparations. In 2020. Over 150 years after slavery ended. I don't feel that it is fair to punish the American taxpayer for something that no one living had anything to do with. The son is not responsible for the sins of the father.
3. **Health Care For Illegal Immigrants:** At a Democratic Party debate, I believe it was sometime last year, the candidates were asked if they support giving government healthcare to illegal immigrants. Every single candidate raised their hand. This is making the hardworking American taxpayer pay for those who shouldn't even be here in the first place.
4. **Biden's Toughness:** I highly doubt that Joe Biden will be as tough on China as Trump. He sure wasn't when he was VP.

These are just a few reasons not to vote Democrat. There are more.",controversial,Republican

When will republican candidates figure this out?,1,x22ap,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/x22ap/when_will_republican_candidates_figure_this_out/,31,1343132942.0,"The republican party is losing support because of the fact that they are so hard against gay marriage.  By denying homosexuals the ability to get married you are denying rights to a group based on their sexual orientation.  This is blatant discrimination that should not stand in this country and republicans are encouraging this discrimination.  I am a republican and I agree with them on almost all other issues but this I cannot tolerate from the leaders of my party.  Please do not bring up the religious argument because the first amendment states ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,"" therefore the religious definition of marriage cannot be used to make a law in this country.  So the federal government is currently denying the following rights, that come with being married, to homosexuals based only on the fact that they are homosexual:

Larger benefits under some programs if married, including:

veteran's disability

Supplemental Security Income

disability payments for federal employees

Medicaid

property tax exemption for homes of totally disabled veterans

income tax deductions, credits, rates exemption, and estimates

wages of an employee working for one's spouse are exempt from federal unemployment tax

Joint and family-related rights:

joint filing of bankruptcy permitted

family visitation rights for the spouse and non-biological children, such as to visit a spouse in a hospital or prison

next-of-kin status for emergency medical decisions or filing wrongful death claims

custodial rights to children, shared property, child support, and alimony after divorce

domestic violence intervention


Preferential hiring for spouses of veterans in government jobs

Tax-free transfer of property between spouses (including on death) and exemption from ""due-on-sale"" clauses.

Threats against spouses of various federal employees is a federal crime

Right to continue living on land purchased from spouse by National Park Service when easement granted to spouse

Funeral and bereavement leave

Joint adoption and foster care

Joint tax filing

and many more.  If the republicans are going to continue to work to deny these rights to homosexuals then I don't think I can continue to support them.

I refuse to support discrimination.

"Why Republican Controlled States Don't ""Dominate"" Job Growth",0,x0fda,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/x0fda/why_republican_controlled_states_dont_dominate/,9,1343072311.0,"**June 2012 Unemployment Rates By State:**

http://www.bls.gov/web/laus/laumstrk.htm/

**Legislative control by state:**

http://www.ncsl.org/documents/statevote/2012_Legis_and_State.pdf

**National Unemployment Rate (8.2%):**

http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm

**The data correctly compiled on a Google Spreadsheet:**

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Ao9SGbBjnRpZdG81UWZtejUxczc0dGJHX0k0bmVrUVE

**States with unemployment under 8.2%**

* 16 Republican
* 8 Democrat
* 8 Split
* 1 Unicameral

**States with unemployment at 8.2%**

* 1 Republican
* 2 Split

**States with unemployment above 8.2%**

* 5 Republican
* 3 Democrat
* 6 Split

Since there are more republican states over-all, the larger numbers in the ""below national avage category"" are larger. Indeed, there are more republican states with higher than national average unemployment as well. Does this mean they ""Dominate"" high unemployment too? No. That's merely a wrong way to interpret the data. Let's look at states as a percentage of their total number to get a more accurate view.

Unemployment rates under 8.2% (Good Performers)

* 72.7% of Republican States
* 72.7% of Democratic States
* 52.9% of Split/Unicameral States

Unemployment rates at 8.2% (Match the national average)

* 4.5%  of Republican States
* 0%    of Democratic States
* 11.7% of Split/Unicameral States

Unemployment rates over 8.2% (Bad Performers)

* 22.7% of Republican States
* 27.2% of Democratic States
* 35.2% of Split/Unicameral States

What we see here is that there isn't a huge difference between Republican and Democrat unemployment rates. In fact, the percentage of states under the national average for each of the groups is identical. Interestingly, all the states which are split or are controlled unicamerally are performing horribly. 

Most of the states in both the top and bottom ten are Republican.

My loss of Confidence; Mitt's bid,0,w2rlr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/w2rlr/my_loss_of_confidence_mitts_bid/,43,1341525524.0,"With the Presidential Election in full swing, and the candidates battling away at each other, I've found that I've lost complete faith in Mitt's ability.   The propoganda campaign that's in full swing against him is telling, and while I understand that it's the tools of the current president and his understanding of current media tools, I can't help but look out and see that the strategy behind that is more effective simply because of it's design.  It's not slander, it's not blaming Mitt for anything.  It's designed to pick up the hot topics of the younger generation and find a connection.   Unfortunately for Romney, the connections it's making are damning. 

Needless to say, I've felt for a while that while both Candidates are nearly identical (As I think was the Republican design; Field someone Obama's right could vote for), I feel that it's NOT who I want for a president.  More so, I've felt that in this Presidential run, the strategy of the lesser of two evils has worked, and I'm seriously considering of not voting as a form of protest in my own party.

tl;dr  I'm unhappy with the candidate presented, and looking for reasons to change my mind.

Unfortunately, the type of right-leaning reading I'm finding among my right-leaning friends isn't helping much.

But surely, modern, media-savvy right-wing thought has better icons than this.  So, /r/Republican, where do you get your news?  Even better, what leads you to prefer these sites?

(If you're feeling frisky, you can also tell me what sites you think define the left, and what you think of them.  I'm sure it would be perspective enhancing.  But mainly I want real info on the above.)

Edit: Thanks for this.  Drudge shows up a lot in this list.

Tea Party Patriots are stupid, illiterate, racist, and mean.
 
That is the message being promoted by socialist multi-billionaire George Soros on his new website, TeaPartyTracker.org.  He and his coalition are set to spend millions upon millions of dollars to make the American public believe that message as part of their war on you and us.
 
Why are they doing this?  Why will they go to such lengths to smear and insult the honor of tens of millions of their fellow American citizens?
 
The answer is that they know the vast majority of the American public supports Tea Party Patriots' values of fiscal responsibility, constitutionally limited government, and free markets.  Having an open discussion on these three basic, common sense subjects is like shining sunlight on vampires to them.  So they attack viciously to change the subject.
 
Their goal is to make American's afraid to speak the truth for fear of being labeled as a brainless, slack-jawed, bigot.
 
Are you afraid?
 
Will you be manipulated into silence by their lies?
 
Will you sit back and allow them to drive America into ruin because you don't want them to call you a few names?
 
Of course not!  And neither will we!
 
We are American Tea Party Patriots!  We embody the spirit that has driven every generation of Americans to fight for justice and freedom.  To assume that they can douse that spirit with a few simple insults is absolutely ridiculous.  Clearly they have no idea what America and Americans are all about.
 
So we will fight!
 
We will fight with the energy of American patriotism that has never been defeated.  We will drive them out of power and back into the shadows.  We will inform, educate, and motivate our fellow citizens with the truth.  And together we will take back our country!
 
Can we rely on you to help us achieve victory?
 
Our enemies will spend incredible amounts of money in their war against us.  We must be able to take the fight to them in the media and with feet on the ground.  For that we need money.
 
Is protecting America from socialism worth $500 to you?  Are you able to give more?  Can you find a way to donate $1,000, $2,000 or $5,000 to add to our strength?  Do you have friends, family, and neighbors who you can ask to band together for a $10,000 group donation?
 
The election is less than 56 days from now.  That's not much time.  We need you to act now and donate any amount that you can.  Donations of $10, $25, $50, and $100 are the lifeblood of our organization and are greatly appreciated.
 
Please forward this email to everyone on your email list.  Please share this email on your Facebook page.  Please attend a Tea Party Rally on 9/12 or on one of many other dates.  And please alert others to the importance of this cause.

This violent negative attitude, equating opposition to enemy does nothing but stall government (just look at the budget negotiations with Obama, Boehner and Cantor, nobody should be proud of anything that happened there). 

FDR famously said after a meeting with a group urging him to take action on an issue they believed in ""I agree with you, I want to do it, now make me do it."". What America needs right now isn't rallying behind any one party. The people need to go out, and let their representatives know that they need to stop pandering to the base and work together for a solution to America's problems.

**EDIT:** People seem to be getting tied up in policy nonsense. The idea behind this is that while Wayne didn't agree with Kennedy's policy, he respected the office of the President, and because he was President, hoped those policies worked to make America a better place. Patriotism isn't partisan. If you really love your country, you would support it's President. Bush may have been disliked, but I'm sure everyone hoped his policies worked. Many of them didn't, but it's vile to hope they wouldn't. You may think they won't work, but you still, as a patriot, hope that they will.

My name is Matt Farrugia, and I'm a PhD student in Psychology. A colleague and I are currently in the process of developing a new political questionnaire which aims to move beyond simplistic notions of ""left wing"" or ""right wing"" and to measure political preferences in a more complex, multifaceted way which allows for the varied nuances of people's belief systems to be fully represented. The questionnaire asks about major political values and reasons for voting and takes about 20 minutes to complete. We are hoping to send personalized results (to those who want them) as soon as our sample is large enough to make some generalizations.

Currently, we're in the process of piloting our new questionnaire and need as many US citizens as possible to complete it. If you are from the US and would like to complete the questionnaire, it would be very much appreciated. The questionnaire can be accessed from:

If anyone has any questions or comments, just let me know.

1. Capitalism is a proven entity with many safety nets to make sure no one is without housing (if they choose) or food. Communist countries have never been successful and have 70 percent of their people below the poverty line.
2. From the first day Trump was elected there have been violent protests masquerading as peaceful protests against his legal election by the American people.
3. Trump has done more for African Americans in his career as a businessman and a president then someone like Joe Biden who actually gave the eulogy at Strom Thurmonds funeral. Now who's racist?
4.  The left is quashing free speech by only allowing newspapers to defend Democratic policies and is now spreading to the average person's workplace. At most professional companies if you had a Trump sign at your desk you'd be fired or ridiculed but a Biden sign is fine.
5. The BLM movement has turned on every Democratic mayor that has tried to support them as not radical enough.
6.  African Americans would benefit from economic investment into black owned business loans, college scholarships and other educational opportunities. We should encourage companies to have diversity goals but not require it. African Americans would benefit more from opportunities than handouts that aren't owed.
7. America is a nation of freedoms bound by laws. Any attempt to use protest as a weaponized way to circumvent the law or sway opinion by promising violence should be met by a rejection by us as a people.
8. Every sexual harassment claim against a Republican is believed. Every one against a Democrat is glossed over. (Biden, Franken etc.)
9.Many people in the left operate under the fairness fallacy. That is to say that because the world is not fair that someone is to blame. The only thing to blame is the fact that people as a whole have¬† competing values, ideas and goals and that is what society is .
10. The left is following the Lenin playbook to the nth degree. Selectively portray stories in the media, attack and ridicule traditional values, attempt to get people tied to emotion and  not reason and subvert the authority of the government.",controversial,Republican

I attended BOTH rallies, Trump‚Äôs and Biden‚Äôs and needless to say, my mind was blown when I went to Trump‚Äôs. I never experienced such a magnitude of patriotism and unity. Numerous black people and other POCs were there, the majority of mainstream news would never show that. They looked happy and they were being treated equally from what I saw. People didn‚Äôt even treat them like black people, they were regular people like all other people. The primary message of the rally was to make our country better and the vibes were nothing but positive and energetic. In comparison, Biden‚Äôs rally was all about why Trump is a bad president and the energy was absolutely negative. People were angry and bitter, looking as if they were ready to beat up whoever expressed their support for Trump. This opened my eyes and made me realize where the hatred is truly coming from. As a longtime Democrat, I will be voting for Trump. We must start improving our country through unity, love, and positivity, which is completely opposite from what Democrats want at the moment.

Edit 1: clarification: what I mean by ‚ÄúPeople didn‚Äôt treat them like black people‚Äù is that they did not intentionally sympathize and treat them like victims just because they were black. They treated them like all other people regardless of the skin color. Sorry, English isn‚Äôt my first language and the wording could have been better.

Edit 2: thank you so much for all the awards! Never had an award before. :) This kind of outcome is not what I expected, let‚Äôs continue to stay united!

Edit 3: if you reported this post or feel the need to report, I strongly encourage you to open your mind and attend BOTH events instead of having all your thoughts formed by the mainstream news. Ability to keep your mind open and listen to both sides through unbiased lens is an extremely vital skill to have nowadays. If you still don‚Äôt agree with me, I still love you and will never treat you differently solely because of your political stance. Cheers!",top,Republican

I feel like the message created by black lives matter is very different to that of the civil rights movement 56 years ago. That movement was one that strived to end both racial division and racial inequality. I can certainly see the stance against racial inequality in BLM, but not racial division.

MLK preached to Americans about black and white Americans being in unison. He promoted the meaning of America's creed, and promoted that black and white destiny are part of one another. He had a dream where the black and white people identified as Americans before they identified by their colour. Unfortunately, this is not the message BLM creates.

BLM has managed to make white people who have felt prejudice towards black people feel even stronger about this by creating demands like defunding police departments (And there is no denying,  police do far more good than harm in society, so defunding them will reduce a lot of the good they do) and by tearing down and destroying the history of countries (such as statues in America and Britain). These attacks on history are like an attack on the pride of people who feel strongly about the importance of their country's history. It has also managed to make black people who strongly hate racism hate it to the point where they want to fight it through violence, and has convinced them that racism is the blame for all problems in their lives.

As you can see above, the message created by BLM is very different to that of the civil rights movement, and I think it's almost like an insult to the legacy of MLK that this is where the struggle against racism has come to.

Another problem with BLM is the fight against systematic racism they preach about, because the truth is, systematic simply isn't real. Every citizen in countries like America has complete equality of opportunity. Everyone is given an equal opportunity to rise to the top. However, not everyone has the same starting point. And the truth is, a higher proportion of the black population in America and these countries begins at a low starting point than the proportion of white people who do. But this isn't because of systematic racism. The system isn't causing this. This is because of historical racism. For the majority of it's history, America has been a racist country, where people of certain skin colours do not have equal opportunities. There has been equality for only 56 years, compared to the roughly 200 years of systematic racisn. This means that, no matter what the system does, there is still going to be inequality between majority black and majority white communities. This is something everyone must accept, and must understand that the solution to this comes in two parts. The government providing funding to black communities to go towards education and quality of life, and black people in these communities understanding that they must take responsibility for their futures and their families' futures (meaning that this mentality of blaming systematic racism must stop).

I feel like the solution to all of this is a movement that wouldn't use methods of violence whatsoever, and instead of protesting against systematic racism which simply isn't real, it should preach to Americans of all races the importance of American values, which seem to have been forgotten over the generations. Through this, I hope, Americans can become united under a single national culture, and would no longer see themselves as divided from each other. It would also convince people in black communities to stop the ideas in black culture that have caused a lack of responsibility, causing things like single motherhood rate since the civil rights movement to go up by 40%.

I doubt that this message will reach many people. Mabye it will be censored. Mabye it will be ignored because of my age. But I really hope to see changes in how the world views race, changes I know we can reach, but not in the way we are currently doing it.

BLM Donated Money is not going to Black Communities but rather to the pockets of Leftist Political Candidates!,1262,h13fs6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/h13fs6/blm_donated_money_is_not_going_to_black/,121,1591924303.0,"
1- Go to BlackLivesMatter.com.
2- Click on the 3 bars on upper right corner and then click the Donate button.
3- Scroll down to Number 2- Read about Actblue Charities (this is where all the donations are going).
4- Go to https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/expenditures.php?cycle=2020&cmte=C00401224
*‚¨ÜÔ∏è This page will show you where the money has gone that has been donated to Actblue Charities.
5- Click ‚ÄúExpenditures‚Äù.
6- Scroll down until you see ‚ÄúTop Vendors/Recipients‚Äù.

So if for some reason you don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre seeing what this page is telling you is that hundreds of millions of dollars that have been donated to the black lives matter movement are instead donated directly to Democratic politicians.

Hundreds of millions of dollars donated are not even going to black communities to help in any way, shape, or form! Over 300 MILLION DOLLARS alone went towards ‚ÄúBernie for President‚Äù and Biden‚Äôs campaign...none of that went to help black communities AT ALL!

Feel free to correct me if I missed something...

Edit: Hello my leftist friends. I am a nerd and love Star Trek. Anyone who does not think socialism is a wonderful idea is selfish or just an ass hole. But people are shitty. Not all of them , but most of them. So it will not work because of that. I get it. I left college super brain washed and worked construction for a long time. The whole time I felt cheated because I was doing all the work and the company owner was making the money. ""Nobody cares. Work harder"".

"Well, I'm voting straight-ticket Republican, Trump and all",1076,j9k80m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j9k80m/well_im_voting_straightticket_republican_trump/,305,1602505454.0,"I made this username a couple years ago and that was my sentiment at the time. I was never a 'vote blue no matter who' type because that mentality allows the DNC to do whatever they want, and I frankly won't be told to fall in line. I voted 3rd party in '04, Obama in '08, 3rd party in '12 and '16. State and local politicians I've voted for have mostly been Democrat. My views have never fallen cleanly on one side or the other, but I've mostly leaned liberal.

This brings me to Why I'm Voting Republican:  
1. Woke shit. I've been on the receiving end of woke hatred over men who fancy themselves women for a long time. I'm well acquainted with critical theory and all its crazy spawn. I'm not down for the struggle sessions, the authoritarianism, the illiberal silencing of dissent. Now that we have Evergreen playing out in the streets, schools, and HR departments across the Western world, I have no choice but to vote for the party standing against it. This alone would be enough for me to vote for Trump.  
2. Media is lying to me. I believed those pictures of kids in cages were put there by Trump. I believed the shooting of Breonna Taylor was the result of a no-knock warrant executed on the wrong address. I believed Trump said neo-Nazis and white supremacists marching with tiki torches were ""fine people."" Turns out I was a sucker, and god damn am I *tired* of this ""peaceful protester"" shit the media is on about.  
3. Fuck the DNC. I wanted Bernie in 2016 and we all know how dirty they did him. When Trump won, my immediate thought was 'at least the DNC will learn their fucking lesson.' Well friends, they're much more resistant to learning than I anticipated. This time around there were a few candidates I could have gotten on board with, but of course the DNC won't let anyone remotely subversive get on the ticket. Fuck em.  
4. LAW AND ORDER. I live in Oregon. It's not going well. Fuck antifa. Fuck BLM. Fuck Kate Brown. Fuck Ted Wheeler. Fuck everyone allowing tent cities full of junkies to blight the landscape. Fuck every 'ACAB' sniveling child.  
5. Yay middle east peace deals.  
6. Fuck China.  
7. Biden is frail and will be 78 and Harris is terrifying and I haaaate her.  
8. Working class. I don't know when the Democrats decided they weren't the party of labor, but now they mostly look down their ivory tower noses at anyone with a little mud on their boots.  
9. Democrats talking about court packing. No, no, no, hell no.  
10. Democrats talking about getting rid of the electoral college, thus disenfranchising the interests of rural people. Nope, never gonna happen.  
11. I'm patriotic. I don't like that seeing an American flag on someone's house, vehicle, or clothing is a pretty good indicator of them being a Republican. Regarding the Democrat party and liberals in general, where is their love of country? ‚ÄúNational pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals: a necessary condition for self-improvement.‚Äù ‚Äï Richard Rorty

As for Trump himself, I think he's a boor. But he's not as big of a bastard as I had believed and I understand him a bit better. He's gonna win for sure, which is not something I thought before the riots started. I'm preemptively pissed about the future of abortion rights, but at least my free speech and gun rights will remain intact. With those two, I have a seat at the table to fight for the rest. 

I'm honestly hoping for a landslide because I think it might be the only thing that can slap liberals hard enough they wake up and get on a better path. The nation works best when there is a healthy push and pull between liberalism and conservatism, and we need to be able to agree on the foundational structures of our country. I see a huge number of left-leaning people refusing to come to the table to talk and wanting to break our system when they don't get their way, and making it clear that won't win them power is the issue of the election.",top,Republican

VP Debate: one part that really stuck with me on the difference between Democrats and Republicans,827,j82tlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/j82tlu/vp_debate_one_part_that_really_stuck_with_me_on/,95,1602291751.0,"I was watching a rerun of  the VP debate yesterday (I know I‚Äôm late) and one line (I guess one part) that really stuck with me about the difference between Democrats and Republicans. 

I forget what exactly was said but Harris was berating Pence for not social distancing / wearing masks / etc. Pence‚Äôs reply really stuck with me because it was along the lines of ‚ÄúYou want to tell people what to do, we trust the American people are smart enough to think for themselves‚Äù

And that line really really stuck with me. I came here from Russia years ago and while I was born after the iron curtain fell, my parents weren‚Äôt so lucky. So many stories about ‚Äúknowing a guy‚Äù, countless instances of ‚Äúback door favors‚Äù

These aren‚Äôt evil people, just regular folks trying to get by (grandma was a teacher, gramps was an engineer in a factory). All this shit they had to do, was because the fucking government made regular life impossible.  To me even I hate authority on that level, I just hate people telling me what to do because I feel like ‚Äúhey man do you think I‚Äôm dumb ‚Äú

Democrats seem to be in this backslide or more and more regulations and I saw it first hand on a recent trip to Cali. While I can‚Äôt put my finger on it, the whole place just felt ‚ÄúOver regulated‚Äù, which is a real fucking shame because it‚Äôs gorgeous there. 

Republicans on the other hand are more keen on stepping back and building a solid foundation for you to go off of. I don‚Äôt need the government doing everything for me, just please give me the basics and I got it from here. 

I feel like Pence‚Äôs comment is a complete reflection of this difference in ideas. I don‚Äôt agree with everything the Republicans do but one thing I am 100% on board with is the notion of ‚Äúhey we‚Äôre just going to leave you the fuck alone‚Äù

Edit: Thanks for the pin mods.

Edit 2: Found a good opinion piece from the LA Times that illustrates the ‚Äúover regulation‚Äù in Cali very well, particularly when it comes to housing https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-broughel-hamilton-overregulation-housing-california-20190703-story.html",top,Republican

Reddit needs some serious changes to ensure what happened to the Covington boys and Kyle Rittenhouse can't happen again.,692,iiv7en,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/iiv7en/reddit_needs_some_serious_changes_to_ensure_what/,124,1598746825.0,"Right now everybody knows that the Covington boys were entirely in the right and were actually the victims of harassment, but at the time Reddit was going absolutely mental about them. The main kid(age 15) was posted to top of all time on r/punchablefaces. Every major thread was slandering him, every major subreddit was abusing him, calling him a ""white supremacist"" and contacting his school and family.

But he was entirely and unequivocally in the right, he was approached by a racist native American man who started smashing a drum in his face while staring him down, completely unprompted. And the thing is everybody knew that at the time, the video was fully available at the time, but every single post made revealing that truth was deleted. Any post that was slightly leaning towards the truth was removed for random reasons that made no sense and the mods had absolutely zero accountability in how they handled what is arguably the most notorious piece of fake news of this century. The controversy revealed some of the most disgusting aspects of humanity, a witch-hunt against literal innocent children. Luckily the main kid sued and won against CNN for estimated low 9 figures and he's moving on to other networks who misrepresented this.

But for all the shit people give Facebook about not deleting fake news Reddit was so much worse in this instance, not only did they not remove the fake stories, all major subs removed only the truth. Videos abusing the kids were let up on r/videos no problem, but videos that actually explained the truth were removed for ""politics"", same thing on all major subs really, if you knew the truth you weren't able to share it with people and try get them to leave the kids alone. All these people abusing children for something that just didn't happen when the full video is out there is so disgusting to me.

The same thing's happening with Kyle Rittenhouse right now, in fact he's already working with the same lawyers that represented the Covington boys against CNN(media's been a bit more careful in blatantly lying about him since that happened, as they should be). You just can't call him a white supremacist who just started firing against innocent black people as is the mainstream prerogative on Reddit right now. First off because it was the most blatant case of self defense known to man when you watch the video, like there's just absolutely no question whatsoever, and second off because the people he ended up killing in self defense were white. He's clearly recorded wiping up graffiti in the city earlier that day and helping store owners with some of the damage caused by riots. The attackers were shouting ""get his ass"" and one of them actually pulled a handgun on him as well. Kyle showed amazing restraint, only making the decision to defend his life after he was already beaten to the ground after attempting to disengage and flee by sprinting away, but his attackers forced him to the ground and one of them raised their handgun to him.

This truth isn't out there on Reddit though, and it's not like you interpret the events in the video in your own way as well, that's objectively what happened. And lawyers are already unanimous on the fact that the worst thing Kyle can be charged for is underage possession of a firearm. Reddit needs serious oversight on things like this. Its impact is just as significant as Facebook's if not more because people take stories on here more seriously. It can't have default subreddits moderate the site in this clearly biased way leading to blatant lies being spread on issues such as this.",top,Republican

Regression,624,hj1gjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Republican/comments/hj1gjp/regression/,99,1593598602.0,"Hi All,

This is my first post on here, but need to clear my mind. I'm an Asian American who immigrated to this wonderful country about 12 years ago. This country has given me the opportunity to become someone and to pursuit the American dream. Seeing the way this country is going truly hurts my heart and my patriotic self, from statues being brought down to this movement that no longer have a meaning. At the start of the movement I was all for it, but now, it really has shifted from a completely unrelated issues. I just don't understand how someone can agree with the logic of the left. Nothing they say or do makes any sense. We are going down a path where erasing history is a must.

Sorry, I just had to get this off of my chest because I love this country so much and to see it go this route really hurts. I really hope we win this election for the sake of preserving this wonderful country which it was based upon freedom, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.

EDIT: Some people are asking if this is an alt-account and it is. I did this to protect myself from my main account which I have co-worker/friends who support the left. ",top,Republican

Yes I know, not Republican, but I side with y'all on most economic issues and gun rights. I can't wholeheartedly support either the Red or Blue candidates this year but the level of disinformation from the left is insane, I often find myself defending Trump against unwarranted claims and exposing Biden because the media thinks his shit doesn't stink. As a libertarian, I respect all rights equally. We may disagree on Gay Rights, Abortion, and Drug Decriminalization; but our core values are the same. I want truth in politics, equal media representation of positives and negatives on both sides. Right now, the Democrats are lying WAY more. What I fear the most is a Democrat in office with the power of the media behind him because he can change so much without any visible media resistance. Social Media is against you, mass media is against you, the truth is twisted tremendously against you. While my beliefs don't align exclusively with Trump or his platform, I feel that Biden is in a position to create a much larger and extended threat to American freedoms.

He's making moves to end the wars we are in.  

**Democrats have brought the violence here to our streets.  They are failing to condemn it and normalizing the idea that even more will happen if they don't get what they want.**

- You tell us Black Lives Matter is just about better police treatment of black people.

**Trump doesn't control the police, so why were people trying to storm the White House?**

- It's just about ""unfair treatment"".

**Why do you all ignore the ACTUAL justice reform that Trump signed?**

 - You think we care nothing about people's lives.

**But you don't say anything about states that passed bills making it legal to abort a child literally as it's being born.**

 - You think we are selfish for wanting to go to church.

**How many crowded funerals did George Floyd get, again?**

 - You chose Biden and try to sell him as a reasonable centrist.

**We know that he may have been that 20 years ago, but he's changed his agenda to be far more ""progressive.""**

 - You call us fear-mongers when we point out that the Democrats have gone a lot further left.

**Bernie and AOC have both said that the far left side of the Democrat party will be able to move Biden even FURTHER left.**

 - You tell us we're ""selfish, greedy bastards.""

**Republicans give more than Democrats do to charity, and do so at all levels of income.**



 - You say that Trump is going to have roaming bands of Nazi brownshirts on the streets terrorizing people.

**You are now gathering to harass diners trying to eat meals outside...demanding they raise their fists, political figures trying to have dinner are being accosted, conservative journalists have had to move from their homes, you are shouting death threats outside the Senate Majority leader's house and now BLM apparently has a group targeting racist ""citizens"" to show up at their homes...**

 - You say that WE are ""in a cult"".

**You have most major media giving you talking points that you agree with and you discuss how you've had to cut actual family and friends out of your life because they like ""Mango Mussolini"".**

 - You say that you are the ones who love minorities.

**The vitriol that you express towards any member of a minority group that champions conservative beliefs is testimony that you do not.**

 - You say that taking our kids to church is child abuse because they are impressionable.

**But when kids are taken to riots by antifa parents and tear gas is deployed, it's the cops' fault for endangering the kids.**

 - You say that you love America.

**You voted for a dude that wanted it fundamentally transformed...you say that ""it was never great"" and some of you are openly wanting a socialist state and you are burning American flags in the streets now.**

 - Teachers are concerned that ""conservative parents"" might overhear the lessons they are teaching our kids.

**You think they have a right to be scared of the parents who are paying their salaries.**

 - You snidely said, ""All buildings matter"" on 9/11.

**BLM Riots Are Officially the Most Costly Man made Damage to American Property in History**

 - You think you are the ones who understand civics.

**You still insist that Hillary *really* won the 2016 election.**

 - You used to deny being socialists.

**Now you often try to make self-posts here asking us, ""What's wrong with having socialism?""**

 - You think that kids making MAGA videos is wrong and exploitative.

**But at the same age it's okay for other kids to do dancing in drag at strip clubs.**

 - You say that we need to have tough conversations about controversial issues.

**But if we have those conversations, you demand that we agree with you or we are accused of engaging in hateful speech.**

 - You demand that subreddits that seem to encourage violence and are conservative be ""shut down"".

**You defend subreddits that advocate violence from the side that is currently PERPETRATING violence in the streets.**

 - You complained when re open protests had armed people at them.

**A member of a black militia actually opened fire accidentally at a BLM protest and shot three comrades in Louisville.  We never hear about it.**

 - You think we're poorly informed due to the terrible media we consume.

**You still don't know the true story of what happened to the Covington kids in DC and you still want Nick Sandmann to suffer for that hate-smirk.**

 - You think that Russia somehow nefariously influenced the last election via social media.

**But you never question who might be behind your favorite left-wing social media sites and posts.**

 - Trump has increased troop pay, improved military readiness, invested in support and worked for REAL reform for a VA long beleaguered by problems.

**You tried to float the idea that Trump hates the troops.**

 - When people say that they are scared to put up a sign supporting the President, many of you say, ""Good... you should be scared.""

**You demand your right to espouse WHATEVER political beliefs you want to, even if you are a commie who wants gulags and if we object, it's McCarthyism.**

 - You said it was grossly offensive, horrible, awful and racist to blame the virus on China.

**But every day you slog on trying to blame the virus on Trump.**

 - You complain at how the virus is decimating the economy.

**But you don't care that the House won't get together with the Senate to cooperate on a Covid relief bill.**

 - You think it's too dangerous to vote in person.

**But you think these protests just *have to happen* because the cause is too important.**

 - You berate conservatives when you see them posting on other subreddits.

**But you get mad when you come here to berate us and you get banned for it.**

 - You think that white people are clueless and pretty racist and generally kinda bad and responsible for most of the suffering in the world.

**But you want us to adopt the Nordic model of healthcare.**

 - You are LGBTQ+ - supportive!

**... but when 45% of gay men say that they are backing Trump...SUDDENLY they are ""immoral.""**

 - You've spent years blaming anti-vaxx on ""the right.""

**But when Biden and Harris suggested that they wouldn't trust a Covid 19 vaccine because Trump is President, you were silent.  They lied, people died?**

 - You keep insisting that the USA is the worst nation at dealing with Covid...

**Per population, seven other countries have done ""worse""...they are Belgium, the UK, Spain, Peru, Italy, Sweden and Chile.**

 - You seem to oppose any measure that would make our vote more secure and less prone to fraud.  You insist that fraud doesn't happen.

**But you are yelling that somehow Republicans are going to steal the election via some nebulous voter fraud.**

 - It's called ""redistricting"" when you Democrats make voting districts.  You say that it's fixing longstanding problems of representation in populations.

**If the Republicans do the same you scream that it's ""gerrymandering that is ruining democracy.""**

 - You think that our only objections to Obama were mustard and that tan suit.  And only because we are racist.

**IRS scandal, unconstitutional DACA, health reform disaster, Fast and Furious, disappearing stimulus money, spying on journalists and persecuting Fox, Iran pallets of cash, incoherent Middle East policy...to name a few...**

 - You suddenly think you need guns because Trump is ""worse than Hitler"" and you might need to protect yourself from the government.

**You are going to vote for a man who just tweeted that he's going to take the guns.**

 - You think it's cute that Joe Biden played ""Despacito"" on his phone to win over Latino voters.

**Latino voters know that the lyrics to that song are:** 

**Slowly**

**I want to breathe in your neck slowly**

**Let me murmur things in your ear**

**So that you remember if you‚Äôre not with me**

**Slowly**

**I want to undress you in kisses slowly**

**Firmly in the walls of your labyrinth**

**And of your body, I want to create a manuscript**

#Mostly folks, you know ... we've NOTICED.

We have noticed these things.  

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Every single thing that gets posted gets downvoted severely by liberals, including the comments within. This is the REPUBLICAN subreddit. If you are a liberal and you are in here - you are going to agree with NOTHING.

I have NEVER been to the /r/liberal subreddit - because I know there is very little that I will agree with there, and I have enough respect for differing opinions to leave them alone on their own subreddit.

The ENTIRE /r/Politics subreddit is completely overrun by liberal Bias. Maybe if /r/politics wasn't a liberal circle-jerk, liberals could argue in the general politics section and would not have to come to /r/republican to find things to disagree with.

I would imagine that the number of republicans on Reddit is dropping by the day as a result of every subreddit being overrun with liberal downvotes. It's a sad day when they hive mind of Reddit drives away all voices of opposition.

Liberals - is this what you want? You want all of reddit to be /r/circlejerk for your political views?

Republicans - share with us some sites where you go to have intelligent political conversation that is not overrun by sneering, runny nose liberals that only want to squelch opposition through power in numbers and not through actual debate.

If you are a republican reading the comments, you'll probably have to click the plus signs next to them, as the liberals in here are downvoting our republican ideas and opinions below the comment threshold in every thread.

Riverside County Superior Court judge Helios Hernandez, appointed by Democrat governor Gray Davis, ordered [624](http://theievoice.com/there-was-so-much-wiretapping-in-riverside-county-even-the-bugs-had-bugs/) wiretaps in 2014, [almost](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/11/dea-wiretap-operation-riverside-california/75484076/) five times more than any other American judge, and 44,000 people and over 2 million conversations were tapped.

I don‚Äôt think that most people realize that ~1/2 of all the cases in the country are coming out of New York City and its surroundings. Besides a few other urban centers, COVID-19 is not spreading uncontrollably fast here. Trump has also freed up billions of dollars towards the recovery effort both medically and economically through the recently passed stimulus package, and the declaration of a national emergency *two weeks ago*. Navy hospital ships have also been docked at various ports across the country. Diagnostic tests are also becoming readily available (there‚Äôs a drive-thru to get tested near my house) The ratio of sick to healthy in the USA is a lot better than most European nations. Per 1,000,000 people in America, 250 are ill. Compare that with Italy (1M:1,400) Spain (1M:1,350) Switzerland (1M:1,500) and Germany (1M:600) and many others. A week and a half ago the media was bashing Trump for fear mongering and being to harsh, but now they‚Äôre saying he‚Äôs not doing shit. Many companies based here have also taken tremendous precautions to keep people and their employees distanced and healthy. Contrary to what some may think, an entire nation with 325 million people can‚Äôt just take a 3 month holiday and expect everything to be normal once it ends. Though the CDC and the president have made a few bad decisions, they are still doing their job to the best of their ability, and Trump‚Äôs latest approval rating shows that (highest point in his presidency thus far)",top,Republican

Once again people are underestimating the amount people who are very much against Democrats and misinformed because of Trump. As someone who lives in a very Republican state Missouri and around Trump supporters more then most I can say without a doubt that the election will be close and I couldn't say who will win either way. 

I'm going to be blunt but the amount of young racists,old racists, are staggering expecially in rural America. Democrats underestimated this group 4 years ago. Obama won because he got votes in a similar fashion as Trump did. Most Republican states never thought in a million years they would have a black president and I think they didn't show up to vote. They assumed Republicans would win easy. 

The same thing happened 4 years ago. People assumed Donald Trump wouldn't win or even come close so Democrats didn't turn out at the polls. Then the unthinkable happened and Donald Trump won. He spoke to those Racist Americans afraid of suburbs being taken. He spoke to the Rural America the small towns and cities. He gave them courage to vote. He gave them a voice. He is doing the same speech again. And like it or not the scared Racist is more motivated to vote then young Democrats.

In doing this research, I came across the For the People Act of 2019. It passed the House of Representatives on March 8, 2019, and is now sitting on Mitch Mcconells desk in the Senate. He claims the bill is a ""one-sided power grab"" and is probably afraid of it putting it to a vote, because if it passed, Republicans would have a lower chance of winning elections, some of there voter suppresion tactics would be made illegal, and they would lose many of there corporate donors who help fund there campaigns.

The goal of the bill is to basically fix democracy, increase voting rights, end a number of voter supression tactics, have gerrymandering be done by independent commisions rather then partisan commissions and do away with big money influencing politics (which often results in decisions being made by big corportations, even if most citizens don't support the decisions).

Here are the key points of the bill that would become law if passed:

* Introduce voluntary public financing for campaigns, matching small donations at a 6:1 ratio
* Impose stricter limitations on foreign lobbying
* Require Super PACs and other ""dark money"" organizations to disclose their donors
* Restructure the Federal Election Commission to reduce partisan gridlock
* Create a national voter-registration program
* Make Election Day a federal holiday
* Require states to use independent commissions to design their congressional districts rather then partisan commissions. If a state declined to do so, the federal government would set one up for them.
* Limit efforts to purge voting rolls

There are also a number of things the bill would support an interest in, or help jumpstart, without actally doing these things if the bill itself is passed, such as:

* Support for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision, where the Supreme Court held that virtually unlimited political spending by corporations, labor unions, and other associations was a constitutional right.
* Support Washington DC become a US state

What are your thoughts on this proposed bill? And should the Senate try to pass this bill if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate in 2021?

&#x200B;

Note: The above is just a handful of the points of the bill from some basic research. For some further information you can view the complete bill on the [congress government website](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr1%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=1). There is also a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act_of_2019) that summarises the bill up pretty well. The bill is named H.R.1 - For the People Act of 2019, in case you wanted to know in order to do your own research on it.",hot,democrats

Yet  they have a long history of attacking the faith of Democrats, in  particular Democratic politicians who are Catholic. Remember when VP  candidate and Catholic Paul Ryan claimed that voting for a Democrat was a  sin? He was not only spreading error, he was committing a grievous and  mortal sin by doing so.

I am a devout Catholic like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. *Have you noticed that in a world of screaming children they are always the most responsible adults in the room?* As a practicing Catholic, I know they are who they are because of their Catholic faith and I love them for that.

Joe  Biden lives his faith as instructed by St Francis: ""evangelize  constantly, even using words when necessary."" When a Fox reporters asked  Speaker Nancy Pelosi why she hates Donald Trump (real fair question,  eh?) she responded ""I don't hate the President; I pray for him every day  and I urge you all to do so."" I was never more proud of Our Lady.  Donald Trump responded by questioning the content of her prayers! (I  think he wanted her prayers investigated.)

I  also know the difference between Trad Catholics who think they are more  Catholic than the Pope. In a world where Pope Francis is a beacon of  hope to the world, he gets criticized by the Trad Catholics for putting  too much emphasis on the suffering of the poor!

For those who are unfamiliar with Catholic theology, a Catholic is forbidden from doing evil for the purpose of achieving good. ***A Catholic can't lie under oath for reasons they think are justified. It's a classic sin.***  A sin is defined as knowing something is wrong, but freely choosing to  do it anyway. And ""the truth"" is defined as the whole truth and nothing  but the truth. Attorney General William Barr claims to be a Catholic but  he uses his religion as a political cleaver.

Maybe some of them have been hypnotized by the current atmosphere of the right, caught up in the flow of traffic, so to speak.

I'm one of the many unlucky individuals dragged to this country as a child (less than 2yo at that time) and not naturalized. One parent is American, the other is Canadian.

I want to ask a question that puts him on the spot but that also makes it both hard for him to dodge and that cannot easily be dismissed by conservatives. I also think that there‚Äôs been plenty of COVID related questions. I figured this community could help me out with picking a couple possible questions.

With that said, if you could ask Trump one question, what would it be?

Just seeing Republicans bitching about wearing masks the entire time really tired me out. Literally every time my dad has to put one on he has to make some sort of philosophical statement or something, like will you just shut the hell up already? I would never say that. I will never say anything until I move out, but just standing by and observing everything, it really opened my eyes up to a lot of things Republicans are about, or maybe they‚Äôve morphed into over trump. And conspiracy theories that COVID is a political move, it will all be over when the election is over. There‚Äôs so many things. There‚Äôs many other things to cause me to do this, but this was the main thing that made me realize I belong on the other side of things. I‚Äôd probably be considered more of a moderate democrat, but honestly I just like to read about economics and politics and not side about a lot of my stances yet. Oh yeah, and because of that, drives me nuts Republicans disregard science. Also, it‚Äôs weird how they think a lot of the Trump tax cuts, or any red tax cut, actually affects them in any significant way compared to the wealthy. I can literally see via policy it didn‚Äôt affect my family much at all. But I digress. Quietly voting Biden 2020.",hot,democrats

Until this year, I was certain Trump was going to be re-elected because -- despite the disaster of Puerto Rico -- the country seemed to be going smoothly...on the surface.  But this year, something happened to the country that has been entirely ignored by the ""statistical models"" seen here.  That something, of course, was COVID-19.  The catastrophic loss of life, accompanied by the economic collapse, has changed the country considerably.  Possibly it has done so in a manner these ""statistical models"" have failed to predict.  My \*hope\* is the outrage over the 210,000+ lives lost -- tens of thousands of which would certainly have been prevented if the Trump administration had simply \*done something\* to respond to the pandemic and organize a proper defense -- will disrupt these ""statistical models"" and bring justice and at least some semblance of recovery to this country.

That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible. Jew, Gentile, Black Man, White, we all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all. Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...

Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think, and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural!

Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ""the Kingdom of God is within man"" not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power, the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power, let us all unite! Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future, and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise! They never will! Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!""",hot,democrats

> The American electoral system is clearly falling apart‚Äîas evidenced by the 2016 presidential election. In It‚Äôs Time to Fight Dirty, David Faris offers accessible, actionable strategies for American institutional reform which don‚Äôt require a constitutional amendment, and would have a lasting impact on our future.

> With equal amounts of playful irreverence and persuasive reasoning, Faris describes how the Constitution‚Äôs deep democratic flaws constantly put progressives at a disadvantage, and lays out strategies for ‚Äúfighting dirty‚Äù though obstructionism and procedural warfare: establishing statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico; breaking California into several states; creating a larger House of Representatives; passing a new voting rights act; and expanding the Supreme Court.

> The Constitution may be the world‚Äôs most difficult document to amend, but David Faris argues that many of America‚Äôs democratic failures can be fixed within its rigid confines‚Äîand, at a time when the stakes have never been higher, he outlines a path for long-term, progressive change in the United States.

This is a book that I really think every Senate Democrat and Biden team member should read. If I had the money I would buy a few hundred copies and send them them to every Democratic Senator and the Biden campaign. Does someone want to setup a fundraiser?

Kamala Harris is in favor of full legalization and has a voting record to prove it. If I have my facts wrong there PLEASE correct me.

Now, the speculation part. Let‚Äôs put it in a few questions:
1. How likely overall is it that federal marijuana legalization happens under a Biden-Harris admin?
2. If it is likely to happen, is there a realistic chance for any sort of federal ruling on prisoners serving time on weed possession charges (NOT intent to distribute which I understand is a different issue)? (I also understand this is partly a state issue where fed gov has limited influence but an official ‚Äúpossession charges are dismissed‚Äù opinion from fed could influence state policy)
3. If you don‚Äôt think fed legalization is likely under Biden-Harris, how many more state legalizations would be necessary before they took action?

To be perfectly clear I have already voted Biden, there is no need to convince me. Just generally curious what ppl think of what might happen with weed federally under Biden-Harris. Thanks in advance for any responses",hot,democrats

Puerto Rico under tides, opioids and suicides;

Dorian Sharpie, trade wars, Giuliani, Census forms;

Tax cuts, bankrolls, the GOP sold it's soul;

MeToo, embassy, NAFTA and TPP;

Kids in cages, sh*tholes, ICE thugs on the payroll!


(Chorus)


Kavanagh, Lindsey Graham, Supreme Court in frat boy hands;

Kim Un, Jinping, strongmen laughing at him;

Kurds betrayed in Syria, Mueller report mania;

Vindman, Sondland, Schiff the prosecution;

Mark, Jim, Moscow Mitch, all are lying sons of b*tch;

Impeached, DOA; please forgive us, USA!


(Chorus)


QAnon, golf again, Russian bounty on our men;

COVID, ""a hoax"", ain't no tests, false hope;

Barr, Pompeo, stock decline, grandma on the front line;

Quarantine, no vaccine, hydroxychloroquine;

A whole country, unemployed, two hundred thousand people died;

George Floyd, protests, Law and Order, loser vets;

Voting circus, postal probe, RGB, and martial law;

Never ending culture wars, I can't take it anymore!


(Chorus Chorus Chorus)


...music fades out...

...then gets stronger again...


Oh please God, not again, got to vote to make this end!

Poor man, tax fraud, deep in debt, who owed? 

Beggin' campaign, Lincoln times, Parscale booked for finance crimes;

Fed militias in white vans, Texas voter hatchet man;

Debate broken, the Proud Boys, like the Devil, just all lies;

Hope Hicks, Trumps are sick, Medivac, limo shtick;

The Rose Garden Massacre, of course he's a COVID spreader;

Gonna start a civil war, We can't take it anymore!

You just don't target high profile public representatives for money, you're doing it for political purposes, especially when you're already a member of a highly political and radicalized insurgency group. So by the very definition of terrorism this sounds like text book domestic terrorism to me.

The five House races I found that can be flipped most easily are:

CO-03 Diane Mitsch Bush

VA-05 Cameron Webb

MI-03 Hillary Scholten

TX-24 Candace Valenzuela

OH-01 Kate Schroder

These races are within reach of winning, all are Republican held seats, and the list of candidates is EXCELLENT-- all diverse (women and/or minority).

Briefly, I took 538.com's House odds, selected the most competitive races, and went to [OpenSecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org/) to find out how much money each candidate raised and has spent. I quickly made a Spreadsheet and came up with a metric to determine how far a dollar raised could go in swinging the race.

(NC),4,j6yqay,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j6yqay/help_trouble_getting_an_absentee_ballot_nc/,5,1602131298.0,"Hi everyone, I need absentee ballot advice. My girlfriend is registered to vote in North Carolina in her home county, but she's been living with me in a different county in NC for about 8 months due to school/wifi. She tried three months ago to change her voter registration to reflect her school dorm address (we didn't know if my home address would be accepted but she still had a university dorm room in her name), and this did not work. She tried again, and it didn't work again, even though I successfully changed my address from my dorm to my home address on the first try. Eventually she just decided to change her address to her moms new address in her home county (which worked on the first try) to request an absentee ballot from her home county back in the beginning of September, and for a month now the tracker has just said it's ""in the mail"". Last week, she contacted a Board of Elections official in her county, and they said they'll send another ballot and void the first one. They said to call them if the ballot doesn't come in by Friday. Well, it's Wednesday now and still no ballot. We feel like time is running out and we just want her to be able to vote, but I don't know that I want to risk her vote on them sending a third ballot if the first two have not come in. I made a timeline below so the order of events is more clear:

June: I change my voter registration address from my dorm room address to my home address successfully. GF unsuccessfully tries to change her voter address from her home county to her dorm room address at university. Two weeks later, she tries again, it is still unsuccessful.

July: GF changes her voter registration address to another address in the **same county (home county)** because her mom moved. This works on the first try.

Early September: We both request our absentee ballots. Mine comes within two weeks, hers does not come in. 

Early October (last week): GF emails board of elections email for her county. Someone responds saying that they'll send another, and that the first one is void. They say if the other one doesn't come in by Friday (10/9), to give them a call. As of today (Weds 10/7) she still has not received a ballot.

&#x200B;

My question is: If the second ballot doesn't come in by this Friday (10/9), is it too late to change her voter registration? She's lived with me at my home address ever since March (about 8 months), could she get in contact with someone from my county and change her voting address to my home address? Or is it too late for that? We're not able to travel up to her home county for her to vote in person, but if we could change her address to be my home address, then at the very least she could vote in person here.

Also if it matters, my county is a much more central county and her home county is up in the mountains. Also she's got a very Hispanic sounding last name, and I am very white, so we were wondering if this could have something to do with voter suppression or if it's just because USPS is janky right now :/

Please let me know if any of this isn't clear!",hot,democrats

My name is Ryan and I'm the Host of Don't Call This A Podcast, a politically focused Podcast that has covered the 2020 election cycle since May. DCP is part of the Kids Wear Crowns, a multimedia and entertainment blog focused on providing the perspective of Black Millennials.

 We've had the pleasure of interviewing several state politicians in Georgia, including Sa Park, who was recently featured in the keynote address at this year's DNC. 

On Friday, we have the pleasure of interviewing Senator Jones, who is facing a challenging re-election campaign in Alabama. This is important to us because half of KWC is from Alabama and all of us have lived there at some point in time.

We wanted to also be able to crowd source our questions, to be able to let people submit questions for us to ask Senator Jones, on top of what we've got ready to go.

The link is below, please submit your questions here. We'll be live on Facebook (The Kids Wear Crowns), Twitter/Periscope (@TheKwCBlog) and the YT link below.

God knows why people are still accepting those positions from him.  Try and woo back many of the people that used to the job competently.  Especially in the EPA
* Executive action undo all Trump's executive actions unless he accidentally did a good one without realizing it.

I expect the republicans will go back to full obstructionism a la the Obama era.  If Biden wants it - it's bad, kind of thing  That's what the executive actions are for.  Good for the goose, good for the gander and all that.",new,democrats

"Thoughts on the For the People Act of 2019 aimed at fixing democracy, that has died in the current Senate?",2,jby3og,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/jby3og/thoughts_on_the_for_the_people_act_of_2019_aimed/,0,1602830900.0,"I was researching all the proposed bills Democrats have passed in the House of Represetatives which they hold a majority in under the current congress, that have died in the Senate that is currently a majority of Republicans. 

In doing this research, I came across the For the People Act of 2019. It passed the House of Representatives on March 8, 2019, and is now sitting on Mitch Mcconells desk in the Senate. He claims the bill is a ""one-sided power grab"" and is probably afraid of it putting it to a vote, because if it passed, Republicans would have a lower chance of winning elections, some of there voter suppresion tactics would be made illegal, and they would lose many of there corporate donors who help fund there campaigns.

The goal of the bill is to basically fix democracy, increase voting rights, end a number of voter supression tactics, have gerrymandering be done by independent commisions rather then partisan commissions and do away with big money influencing politics (which often results in decisions being made by big corportations, even if most citizens don't support the decisions).

Here are the key points of the bill that would become law if passed:

* Introduce voluntary public financing for campaigns, matching small donations at a 6:1 ratio
* Impose stricter limitations on foreign lobbying
* Require Super PACs and other ""dark money"" organizations to disclose their donors
* Restructure the Federal Election Commission to reduce partisan gridlock
* Create a national voter-registration program
* Make Election Day a federal holiday
* Require states to use independent commissions to design their congressional districts rather then partisan commissions. If a state declined to do so, the federal government would set one up for them.
* Limit efforts to purge voting rolls

There are also a number of things the bill would support an interest in, or help jumpstart, without actally doing these things if the bill itself is passed, such as:

* Support for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United decision, where the Supreme Court held that virtually unlimited political spending by corporations, labor unions, and other associations was a constitutional right.
* Support Washington DC become a US state

What are your thoughts on this proposed bill? And should the Senate try to pass this bill if Democrats gain a majority in the Senate in 2021?

&#x200B;

Note: The above is just a handful of the points of the bill from some basic research. For some further information you can view the complete bill on the [congress government website](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr1%22%5D%7D&s=1&r=1). There is also a [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_the_People_Act_of_2019) that summarises the bill up pretty well. The bill is named H.R.1 - For the People Act of 2019, in case you wanted to know in order to do your own research on it.",new,democrats

Hello! I have recently created a new subreddit for Democrat and Democrat-leaning New Yorkers to talk about politics on. This community is meant to be for talking about New York elections and general elections in the USA. Here, you can post questions regarding voting, post polls, post election predictions, talk about current events, etc. Currently, the community is set up with things such as:

* Post flairs (Feel free to message me a suggestion)
* User flairs (We have tons already, but if you want another you can also message me)
* A custom community theme
* Basic rules to follow
* Etc.

Since this community is new, though, we also don't have many moderators, so if you are active you might become one as the community grows bigger. It never hurts to join, so we hope to see you on r/BlueNY soon :)

Yet  they have a long history of attacking the faith of Democrats, in  particular Democratic politicians who are Catholic. Remember when VP  candidate and Catholic Paul Ryan claimed that voting for a Democrat was a  sin? He was not only spreading error, he was committing a grievous and  mortal sin by doing so.

I am a devout Catholic like Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi. *Have you noticed that in a world of screaming children they are always the most responsible adults in the room?* As a practicing Catholic, I know they are who they are because of their Catholic faith and I love them for that.

Joe  Biden lives his faith as instructed by St Francis: ""evangelize  constantly, even using words when necessary."" When a Fox reporters asked  Speaker Nancy Pelosi why she hates Donald Trump (real fair question,  eh?) she responded ""I don't hate the President; I pray for him every day  and I urge you all to do so."" I was never more proud of Our Lady.  Donald Trump responded by questioning the content of her prayers! (I  think he wanted her prayers investigated.)

I  also know the difference between Trad Catholics who think they are more  Catholic than the Pope. In a world where Pope Francis is a beacon of  hope to the world, he gets criticized by the Trad Catholics for putting  too much emphasis on the suffering of the poor!

For those who are unfamiliar with Catholic theology, a Catholic is forbidden from doing evil for the purpose of achieving good. ***A Catholic can't lie under oath for reasons they think are justified. It's a classic sin.***  A sin is defined as knowing something is wrong, but freely choosing to  do it anyway. And ""the truth"" is defined as the whole truth and nothing  but the truth. Attorney General William Barr claims to be a Catholic but  he uses his religion as a political cleaver.

People thought Hillary would win by a landslide. I'm seeing the same situation with Biden and Trump. Everywhere I look it's Biden is leading in Polls and Biden will win by a landslide. 

Once again people are underestimating the amount people who are very much against Democrats and misinformed because of Trump. As someone who lives in a very Republican state Missouri and around Trump supporters more then most I can say without a doubt that the election will be close and I couldn't say who will win either way. 

I'm going to be blunt but the amount of young racists,old racists, are staggering expecially in rural America. Democrats underestimated this group 4 years ago. Obama won because he got votes in a similar fashion as Trump did. Most Republican states never thought in a million years they would have a black president and I think they didn't show up to vote. They assumed Republicans would win easy. 

The same thing happened 4 years ago. People assumed Donald Trump wouldn't win or even come close so Democrats didn't turn out at the polls. Then the unthinkable happened and Donald Trump won. He spoke to those Racist Americans afraid of suburbs being taken. He spoke to the Rural America the small towns and cities. He gave them courage to vote. He gave them a voice. He is doing the same speech again. And like it or not the scared Racist is more motivated to vote then young Democrats.

I want to ask a question that puts him on the spot but that also makes it both hard for him to dodge and that cannot easily be dismissed by conservatives. I also think that there‚Äôs been plenty of COVID related questions. I figured this community could help me out with picking a couple possible questions.

With that said, if you could ask Trump one question, what would it be?

Maybe some of them have been hypnotized by the current atmosphere of the right, caught up in the flow of traffic, so to speak.

Until this year, I was certain Trump was going to be re-elected because -- despite the disaster of Puerto Rico -- the country seemed to be going smoothly...on the surface.  But this year, something happened to the country that has been entirely ignored by the ""statistical models"" seen here.  That something, of course, was COVID-19.  The catastrophic loss of life, accompanied by the economic collapse, has changed the country considerably.  Possibly it has done so in a manner these ""statistical models"" have failed to predict.  My \*hope\* is the outrage over the 210,000+ lives lost -- tens of thousands of which would certainly have been prevented if the Trump administration had simply \*done something\* to respond to the pandemic and organize a proper defense -- will disrupt these ""statistical models"" and bring justice and at least some semblance of recovery to this country.

That's not my business. I don't want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone if possible. Jew, Gentile, Black Man, White, we all want to help one another, human beings are like that. We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery. We don't want to hate and despise one another. And this world has room for everyone, and the good Earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way. Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery, we need humanity. More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities life will be violent, and all will be lost. The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all. Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women, and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people. To those who can hear me, I say do not despair. The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress. The hate of men will pass, and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people. And so long as men die, liberty will never perish. ...

Soldiers! Don't give yourselves to brutes, men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think, and what to feel! Who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder. Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men with machine minds and machine hearts! You are not machines! You are not cattle! You are men! You have the love of humanity in your hearts! You don't hate! Only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural!

Soldiers! Don't fight for slavery! Fight for liberty! In the 17th Chapter of St Luke it is written: ""the Kingdom of God is within man"" not one man nor a group of men, but in all men! In you! You, the people have the power, the power to create machines. The power to create happiness! You, the people, have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure. Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power, let us all unite! Let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future, and old age a security. By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power. But they lie! They do not fulfill that promise! They never will! Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people! Now let us fight to fulfill that promise! Let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance. Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

Soldiers! In the name of democracy, let us all unite!""",new,democrats

The goal is to list every ballot drop box in the country, as well as other places to drop off a ballot without having to wait in line, worry about USPS deadlines, etc. In addition, we're adding as much information about voting in each state and county as we can!

It's a work in progress, and we need help gathering data, but it's already useful. Check out some examples:

'It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build A Lasting Majority In American Politics' by Prof David Faris is a book every Democrat needs to read,2,j8dvv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j8dvv0/its_time_to_fight_dirty_how_democrats_can_build_a/,1,1602331561.0,"> It‚Äôs time to do more than protest‚Äîit‚Äôs time to fix a broken system

> The American electoral system is clearly falling apart‚Äîas evidenced by the 2016 presidential election. In It‚Äôs Time to Fight Dirty, David Faris offers accessible, actionable strategies for American institutional reform which don‚Äôt require a constitutional amendment, and would have a lasting impact on our future.

> With equal amounts of playful irreverence and persuasive reasoning, Faris describes how the Constitution‚Äôs deep democratic flaws constantly put progressives at a disadvantage, and lays out strategies for ‚Äúfighting dirty‚Äù though obstructionism and procedural warfare: establishing statehood for D.C. and Puerto Rico; breaking California into several states; creating a larger House of Representatives; passing a new voting rights act; and expanding the Supreme Court.

> The Constitution may be the world‚Äôs most difficult document to amend, but David Faris argues that many of America‚Äôs democratic failures can be fixed within its rigid confines‚Äîand, at a time when the stakes have never been higher, he outlines a path for long-term, progressive change in the United States.

This is a book that I really think every Senate Democrat and Biden team member should read. If I had the money I would buy a few hundred copies and send them them to every Democratic Senator and the Biden campaign. Does someone want to setup a fundraiser?

Kamala Harris is in favor of full legalization and has a voting record to prove it. If I have my facts wrong there PLEASE correct me.

Now, the speculation part. Let‚Äôs put it in a few questions:
1. How likely overall is it that federal marijuana legalization happens under a Biden-Harris admin?
2. If it is likely to happen, is there a realistic chance for any sort of federal ruling on prisoners serving time on weed possession charges (NOT intent to distribute which I understand is a different issue)? (I also understand this is partly a state issue where fed gov has limited influence but an official ‚Äúpossession charges are dismissed‚Äù opinion from fed could influence state policy)
3. If you don‚Äôt think fed legalization is likely under Biden-Harris, how many more state legalizations would be necessary before they took action?

To be perfectly clear I have already voted Biden, there is no need to convince me. Just generally curious what ppl think of what might happen with weed federally under Biden-Harris. Thanks in advance for any responses",new,democrats

You just don't target high profile public representatives for money, you're doing it for political purposes, especially when you're already a member of a highly political and radicalized insurgency group. So by the very definition of terrorism this sounds like text book domestic terrorism to me.  

Let's hope these anti-American insurgents will be identified and prosecuted appropriately under government with Biden/Harris leadership.  Oh the 2A folks will lose their freakin' minds over it but this is no part of protecting the State, the very opposite of it.

The five House races I found that can be flipped most easily are:

CO-03 Diane Mitsch Bush

VA-05 Cameron Webb

MI-03 Hillary Scholten

TX-24 Candace Valenzuela

OH-01 Kate Schroder

These races are within reach of winning, all are Republican held seats, and the list of candidates is EXCELLENT-- all diverse (women and/or minority).

Briefly, I took 538.com's House odds, selected the most competitive races, and went to [OpenSecrets.org](https://opensecrets.org/) to find out how much money each candidate raised and has spent. I quickly made a Spreadsheet and came up with a metric to determine how far a dollar raised could go in swinging the race.

There are plenty of reasons why I disagree with them but my two big points were the bailouts that large companies and billionaires got, before and during the pandemic; and the history of systemic racism and racial bias that occurs in their policies.

My name is Ryan and I'm the Host of Don't Call This A Podcast, a politically focused Podcast that has covered the 2020 election cycle since May. DCP is part of the Kids Wear Crowns, a multimedia and entertainment blog focused on providing the perspective of Black Millennials.

 We've had the pleasure of interviewing several state politicians in Georgia, including Sa Park, who was recently featured in the keynote address at this year's DNC. 

On Friday, we have the pleasure of interviewing Senator Jones, who is facing a challenging re-election campaign in Alabama. This is important to us because half of KWC is from Alabama and all of us have lived there at some point in time.

We wanted to also be able to crowd source our questions, to be able to let people submit questions for us to ask Senator Jones, on top of what we've got ready to go.

The link is below, please submit your questions here. We'll be live on Facebook (The Kids Wear Crowns), Twitter/Periscope (@TheKwCBlog) and the YT link below.

Help! Trouble getting an absentee ballot? (NC),6,j6yqay,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j6yqay/help_trouble_getting_an_absentee_ballot_nc/,5,1602131298.0,"Hi everyone, I need absentee ballot advice. My girlfriend is registered to vote in North Carolina in her home county, but she's been living with me in a different county in NC for about 8 months due to school/wifi. She tried three months ago to change her voter registration to reflect her school dorm address (we didn't know if my home address would be accepted but she still had a university dorm room in her name), and this did not work. She tried again, and it didn't work again, even though I successfully changed my address from my dorm to my home address on the first try. Eventually she just decided to change her address to her moms new address in her home county (which worked on the first try) to request an absentee ballot from her home county back in the beginning of September, and for a month now the tracker has just said it's ""in the mail"". Last week, she contacted a Board of Elections official in her county, and they said they'll send another ballot and void the first one. They said to call them if the ballot doesn't come in by Friday. Well, it's Wednesday now and still no ballot. We feel like time is running out and we just want her to be able to vote, but I don't know that I want to risk her vote on them sending a third ballot if the first two have not come in. I made a timeline below so the order of events is more clear:

June: I change my voter registration address from my dorm room address to my home address successfully. GF unsuccessfully tries to change her voter address from her home county to her dorm room address at university. Two weeks later, she tries again, it is still unsuccessful.

July: GF changes her voter registration address to another address in the **same county (home county)** because her mom moved. This works on the first try.

Early September: We both request our absentee ballots. Mine comes within two weeks, hers does not come in. 

Early October (last week): GF emails board of elections email for her county. Someone responds saying that they'll send another, and that the first one is void. They say if the other one doesn't come in by Friday (10/9), to give them a call. As of today (Weds 10/7) she still has not received a ballot.

&#x200B;

My question is: If the second ballot doesn't come in by this Friday (10/9), is it too late to change her voter registration? She's lived with me at my home address ever since March (about 8 months), could she get in contact with someone from my county and change her voting address to my home address? Or is it too late for that? We're not able to travel up to her home county for her to vote in person, but if we could change her address to be my home address, then at the very least she could vote in person here.

Also if it matters, my county is a much more central county and her home county is up in the mountains. Also she's got a very Hispanic sounding last name, and I am very white, so we were wondering if this could have something to do with voter suppression or if it's just because USPS is janky right now :/

Please let me know if any of this isn't clear!",new,democrats

The part I find so puzzling is the channels that claim to hate the man have nothing else to do than talk about every time he sneezes or passes gas. Look at CNN. I used to respect you as a real news channel, but it doesn't matter what time of the day I click to your channel, It all has to do with Trump. Don't you remember that this is what got us in this mess in the first place. All of you anchors joked about ""How crazy it would be if this no chance candidate took the election"" and then it happened. It's because you broke the rules about equal air time. You were so mesmerized by all of his crazy antics that you couldn't help yourself but to report on every single one of them. You make him the GOP front runner by choosing to talk about him and only him. I believe poor Jeb Bush only got air time when you were lambasting him or laughing at him. Are you really so stupid that you don't see what you are doing. If you bring up Black Lives Matter, better hold your hat because Don Lemon is going to get on his moral high horse and talk directly to the President. Cuomo, I love you dude, but you are a main offender. What do you do? You tell use how dire the situation is, then you pan right to camera and talk directly to our president. When will you get it? He has tricked you into doing the only thing he wants you to do. Keep him in the new cycle. Here is an experiment you won't do, but would be the most effective thing you could do for the mission you all claim to be on. Don't talk about him. Report the news. You remember the news? The stuff that would happen that wasn't related to whatever crazy antics Donald Trump was up to. You fall for it like suckers every time. He grabs a flag weird, and you spend the majority of the day laughing at him, but he is still all you are talking about. And I swear on all things, If you do another of your ""Let's get real"" speeches with the president, I may stop watching CNN and MSNBC all together. All you do is feed this mans ego, and then I get to listen to Don Lemon or whatever stand in at the time it is talk directly to camera, even saying 'Mr. President..... You are a terrible president (in essence.) Why don't you act like a decent human being?"" News flash hot shot, He isn't listening or you are just feeding the beasts ego. He doesn't give a second thought to ""fake news"" Don Lemon or Andrew Cuomo. So why not do something better with your time. Every story doesn't have to be followed up by ""and the president did nothing."" because that shows me that the entire story you just did was just to call him out. Seriously. Do you even realize you are doing it? It has been months on months on months of you regurgitating the same talking points over and over. What can this man do that won't surprise you at the point? Stop putting him on air. ITS ALL YOU EVER DO,  ""Trump didn't say this right thing as he left the white house today."" We don't care anymore. It is expected. You wanna know the real exhaustion Americans are going through, Its of you tieing every single thread you can to his presidency. You will never win any award with this type of blatant BS. You are becoming a reverse Tucker Carlson. ""OOOO the president held a press briefing where he stormed off."" Well duh, He does that. ""OOOOOO He won't denounce white supremacy."" Have you forgotten who you are talking about. Keep treating every little thing his does as te worst offense that could ever have happened, and you'll be the ones responsible for his re-election just like you were in 2016. How much air time do you think he got in 2016 just based off of you reporting the crazy stuff he did? Do you think it was equal to Hilary, because the only time you brought her up was with scandal as well. You're news cycle shouldn't exist. It was made for 9/11 when we really didn't know what tomorrow would bring, but as I write this now, test me. Watch Don Lemon and Cuomo tonight. Remember my words when they go through all the ridiculous things they keep saying about Trump, and masks, and how he doesn't listen to the task force. Then make sure they pull in close with camera one as you tell the president ""the business."" Where did your integrity go? Where did your since of pride go? I am a democrat and you are disgusting me. You give the Trump supporters all the fuel they need because he is literally all you talk about. You may pepper a story in for 5-10 minutes, but then it's the Trump show again.Please realize what you are doing because you are the problem. If his only stage was Fox News, He would fail dramatically, but you still give this creaton air time. Get your life together cable news.

What Are You Hiding Bernie???

Five of the original seventeen Republican candidates for president in 2016 released various tax returns for various years. On the Democratic side, two of the original six candidates released various tax returns for various years.

Hillary Clinton released fifteen years worth of complete tax returns, from 2000 to 2014.

Bernie Sanders released only one year of partial tax returns -- 2014 -- and did not release any of the attachments, like what charitable donations he made (if any) and what deductions he took. (We know he took deductions above the standard level because of the relevant line on the partial return that he released.)

So this leaves us wondering: **What is Bernie Sanders Hiding? Why won't he release more tax returns? Why didn't he release his full 2014 return?**

All these news commentary channels lean heavily in favor of Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nominee. That is fine. Maybe they have the wisdom we need about that. However, I don't think that it's right for them to waste a lot of breath attacking Pete Buttigieg.

In my view, these pontificators are trying to make the Democratic nomination process into one where we judge the candidates on the basis of their personality.

Some people may believe that Bernie Sanders is the most principled person, because he will fight for the cause of the Progressive Left. 

I personally disagree. I believe that Buttigieg and Yang are the most principled people, because they are gentle and smart... and have strong convictions that will always inform the way that they work with their teams.",controversial,democrats

 We will let the progressive part go for right now, that is mater of degrees, but saying she can get her agenda passed because it is, dare i say it, more moderate than Sen. Sanders policies is absurd. 

 The Republicans hate her! But somehow Mrs. Clinton thinks that they will accept her with open arms that is laughable.

Here is that very argument @ the 9:00 mark of this video

http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/iowa-caucuses-good-for-democracy-614662723599

>Spot check of Hillary Clinton's Senate record fails to support bipartisanship claim

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/20/hillary-clinton/spot-check-hillary-clintons-senate-record-immolate/

This is all in response to the claim that she could get more done as POTUS than Sanders and there is no reason to believe that.

I don't think unless you can get control of the house...anything of a progressive nature can get passed. So this is about changing hearts and minds before 2020. And I don't see the ""Single payer will never pass"", 3rd way wing of the Democratic party as the best way to frame our message...I have serious doubts if they are even the most electable...the great centrist voter is a myth, and turning away your base has been and will always be a losing strategy! ...Just ask Alison Lundergan Grimes how well it worked for her.

Turn out.. turn out... turn out, had better start being something we talk about before election night.

>2012 Election Turnout Dips Below 2008 and 2004 Levels: Number Of Eligible Voters Increases By Eight Million, Five Million Fewer Votes Cast

Republicans a minority party, turn out more by catering to their base and Democrats like sheep follow them to the right losing their own base in the process and not picking up anybody but those who are sickened by the GOP.

>Democratic turnout also increased in only two states and the same states‚ÄîLouisiana (up .4 percentage points) and Iowa (0.1) The largest decreases were in New York (minus 7.8 percentage points), DC (-7.1), Utah (-6.7), and Illinois (6.4).

>Republican turnout increased in 15 states led by North Dakota (up 2.7 percentage points), followed by Wisconsin (2.5), Utah (1.6), Iowa (1.5) and Massachusetts (1.1). The largest decreases were in Indiana (minus 5.1 percentage points), followed by New Jersey (-4.7), New York (-4.5), Oklahoma (-3.7) and Mississippi (-3.4).

Now back to that more progressive claim

Now if you think that Universal healthcare is wrong... a bad idea say so, but don't blow smoke up my ass and say... ""No we we can't""

 ...right after this ...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjXyqcx-mYY

I seriously hope she doesn't say it is a dream...you know what video comes after that.

Mrs Clinton's spokesman calls the vote on the Iraq war ""a Foreign policy question 15 years ago""...

I believe that this is the best way for us to retain Bernie Sanders voters and to defeat Trump. Since defeating Trump is not their main issue chances are many of them would not vote for Biden. Also, Bernie has sadly been beating Biden in large numbers with the young vote, independents and Latinos even in states where Bernie lost. I believe we need as much help as we can get.

Let's be very clear, Hillary supporters: **YOU NEED US TO AVOID A GOP WHITE HOUSE**

For Bernie supporters, this primary is very emotional. We want to avoid a GOP presidency and therefore support the candidate who, according to all available evidence, is more likely to attract the necessary independent voters to win. But more importantly than that, we see Bernie's candidacy as the best shot we've ever had to fundamentally reform our electoral system. Never before have we seen a candidate who is this grassroots. If Bernie doesn't win, we are scared that won't have another shot at this for a long, long time. My personal guess is 16-24 years (based on recent history). 

So, every time Hillary supporters take pot shots at Bernie or his supporters, every time they dismiss his transformative candidacy, every time they run up the score by trying to show us just how much the media believe Hillary will win, every time they openly celebrate a Hillary win without recognizing how emotional this is for is...well, simply put, they push us farther away. Get it through your heads: **we are sick of the establishment.** We are already disinclined to rally behind Hillary--stop making it even harder. That is, unless you want President Trump.

I'm so sick of Bernie Sanders campaign nonsense. I am so sick of his dishonesty and lies. Hillary Clinton was damn right when she got pissed at that Greenpeace protester. Sanders is running a very disturbing and disgusting campaign, almost at the level of Donald Trump. I know for months I've been saying ""Bernie or Bust "" is stupid. But you know what, do what you want. I was watching Secular Talk, and Kyle said that that of you live in a swing state you have to suck it up and vote for Hillary or Bernie. But if you live in a democratic safe state, vote your heart. My heart won't let me vote for Sanders, so I never will, and that's okay because I live in New Mexico, a safe state.  So vote for heart and play politics well.

EDIT: Bernie Sanders supporters just a heads up you might be upset at the MSM today. If Cruz wins Wisconsin, and Bernie wins Wisconsin, the media will be dominated by Cruz his victory over. They won't even talk about Bernie Sanders. It will put a serious crimp in his momentum campaign.

Russia doesn't care if Trump or Bernie get elected.

He will further divide the left and right in our country, which is also, \*exactly what Russia wants\*.

Divide, and Conquer.

Anything that makes the USA weaker and creates infighting, they will support.

Why this is not registering, I have no idea. It seems there are millions of voters out there that have not made this connection.

Bernie fans, hate me for speaking the truth. My post is not meant to agitate. But I fear that with either candidate, Russia will increase its world dominance at our expense.

Polarization is bad for the country. Period. Both the far right and far left need to move closer to the middle for our country to be functional. That's the unfortunate reality as much as I agree with some of Bernie's ideas.

Its made me extremely dissillusioned with this party, and i know many who feel the same.

Sanders offers us a candidate that has a strong contrast to Trump's own wealth and ties to power.  [A common refrain at a Trump rally involves Trump asking, ""Should I take the money?"" and the crowd responding with a long ""No!"".](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/geng-ngarmboonanant/donald-trump-is-terrible-for-campaign-finance-reform_b_8509806.html)  Bernie Sanders has funded his campaign entirely with support from small individual donors and labor organizations.
* [Hillary has a long-term unfavorable rating problem in polls since 2013](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/10/13/hillary-clintons-declining-image-numbers-inch-upward/).
* Sanders has been consistent.  Consider some past Presidential attack ads (i.e. [John Kerry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbdzMLk9wHQ)): pointing out an opponent's flip-flopping has been an easy and effective way to stir distrust.
* [Real Clear Politics (which takes averages of numerous different polls) currently](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/favorable_unfavorable.html) has Sanders as the most favorable (net favorability = favorable - unfavorable rate) of all the candidates, blue and red, and leads Hillary by at least 8 points.  [Here's a chart showing how favorability ratings mattered in past elections.](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/04/18/us/politics/fivethirtyeight-0418-lateFAV1/fivethirtyeight-0418-lateFAV1-blog480.png)
* Obama's job approval rating has [averaged around 45%](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/president_obama_job_approval-1044.html) for the last two years.  Polls on ""direction of the country"" have us over 60% [on the wrong track](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html).  The democratic nominee will need to differentiate themselves from Obama in order to win.

**The [Democratic] Socialist**

* [Fox News has made frequent references to Obama being socialist for many years](http://nation.foxnews.com/barack-obama/2012/06/04/obama-socialist-ap-runs-1365-word-fact-check).  If the nominee is not Bernie Sanders, then the Republican news outlets can still point to agreement on policy with Bernie Sanders as evidence of socialist ties.  [Republican politicians in general have labeled their opposition as socialists for more than 20 years](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9Kn9DLN51Y).  There are various approaches to handling this label: Obama's approach was to take the opportunity to explain things that appeal to viewers.
* Bernie's approach is similar to Obama's, but also to embrace the label.  It gives him a great opening to talk about it.  Most voters will see him receive at least 30 seconds to discuss it.  His discussion is reasonable, and the viewers can see that. In fact, it begins to cast doubt on other things they've heard.  And it demonstrates courage that he confronts it head-on and doesn't shy away from what he believes in.
* Most voters have heard Bernie called a socialist by now (he has been called this repeatedly during Republican debates), and yet his favorability among Republicans and Independents voters remains consistently higher than all other candidates (blue & red).
* He has won elections as ""The Socialist"" for 30+ years. Admittedly, it was in the most liberal state, but [he even received 25% of the Republican vote there](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/09/18/bernie_sanders_i_got_25_of_the_republican_vote_in_vermont.html).  There were still plenty of naysayers who claimed he didn't stand a chance when in reality it didn't slow him down.
* His policies are [very popular among Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/), and [are very successful for business among Scandinavians](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2014/12/17/u-s-slides-again-as-denmark-tops-forbes-best-countries-for-business/).  
* Very successful past presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and LBJ held views similar to Bernie Sanders.  The [United States had the largest growth in GDP immediately following FDR's Presidency and the largest growth in employment during Lyndon Johnson's two* terms.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_economic_expansions_in_the_United_States)  *LBJ's first term was the succession of JFK.
* The most popular American programs are heavily socialist in nature (i.e. Social Security).  Even building roads using community funds can be viewed as socialist.

**Political History**

Much evidence for why Bernie will lose is rooted in assumptions about political history:

*  ""The youth don't vote reliably"" - but no candidate has tried appealing to them in a long time.  They also don't show up in polling (polls must model expected voter turnout based on past history), which hurts a candidate's momentum - self-fulfilling prophecy.
* ""The media will sink him"" - but the Internet is a new and powerful tool in our democracy, and each year has growing access and importance.  
* ""The winner is the one who can raise the most money"" - but SuperPACs are new, and Democrats will need a new approach.
* If anything, Democrats should *not* be relying on their old methodologies - Democrats have lost everything but the White House!

**Issues**

* If you rank left/right by [what American voters support](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/06/12/bernie-sanders-says-americans-back-his-agenda-and-hes-mostly-right/), then Bernie's policies are very popular and Bernie isn't even on the left!
* Trump and Sanders are the only two campaigns avoiding SuperPAC money, and this is a key issue for their supporters.
* [82% of Democrats, 78% of Independents, and 78% of Republicans ](http://www.gallup.com/poll/163208/half-support-publicly-financed-federal-campaigns.aspx) want campaign finance reform.  
* [62% think that Upper-Income Americans pay too little in taxes, and 64% think that Corporations pay too little in taxes.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/153947/americans-split-whether-taxes-rise.aspx)  

**Campaign Financing**

* Overall, [Clinton has raised $112M vs Sanders' $73M, yet Clinton has $38M cash-on-hand vs Sanders' $28M](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPyrKY-rbOY).  Sanders has mounted an effective campaign with a smaller burn rate, which he can repeat in the general election.  
* Sanders reached a million individual contributions [faster than Obama did.](http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/remember-obamas-historic-2008-presidential-run-bernie-sanders-so-far-exceeding-it)  He's now announced a record-breaking 3 million contributions from over a million individuals.
* In Q4, [Bernie raised $33M compared to Clinton's $37M.](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/2/10701702/bernie-sanders-fundraising)  At the end of Q4, Bernie received 14% more contribution dollars per supporter, and very few of his contributors were maxed out.  (Source: Ratio of total money raised to [first-choice candidate on 12-31-15 by national poll averages](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_democratic_presidential_nomination-3824.html).)

**Voter Demographics & Appeal**

* Bernie has fantastic positive favorability with independents, who are some of the most important voters in the general election.  [The number of Independent voters in the US is at an all time high at 42%.](http://www.gallup.com/poll/180440/new-record-political-independents.aspx)
* [In the 2008 general election, 25% of votes came from youth under 35.  They were the Dems' strongest age group, voting 63% (to 36%) for Obama, contributing 6.7% toward his overall victory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_2008#Voter_demographics).  The critics who say the youth are unreliable are ignoring that their vote is very important in claiming the White House.
* In the latest poll ([CNN/ORC](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2697606-rel3a-Democrats-2016-2.html#document/p1)), Bernie's net favorability is the strongest of democratic candidates among non-whites.  The same poll also shows heavy agreement with Bernie on the issues that concern non-whites.
* Bernie draws larger crowds than Obama did.  [Source](http://www.alternet.org/election-2016/remember-obamas-historic-2008-presidential-run-bernie-sanders-so-far-exceeding-it)
* Bernie has very avid and enthusiastic supporters.  This helps voter turn-out, especially against attack ads.
* [Only 17% of Democrats and only 30% of Republicans were 'satisfied' with Upward Mobility & Income/Wealth Equality](http://www.gallup.com/poll/181340/satisfied-ability-ahead.aspx).",controversial,democrats

I thought it was a mistake to support Hillary because the right (and Russia) had a big campaign against her that was working very well. I feel the same way this time around. I was in groups with a lot of older Dems telling them how dangerous it is to support Biden in the primary for the sole reason that so many young voters would turn their backs on the political process, not just in this year's election but for many elections to come. I was trying my hardest to make them see how harmful that could be. And now I'm in groups with mostly young voters, trying to make *them* see the dangers of sitting out in November. Of walking away from the party completely. I've been called many names and a lot of my posts have been taken down in all of these groups. And I can't help but think of Dr. Seuss' The Zax lol. I believe in Bernie, I believe in his policies and his vision. But I am definitely ""blue no matter who"" ~~with some limitations.~~

Why? Because I personally have a lot to lose with 4 more years of Trump. With quite possibly his third Supreme Court appointment. In his first two years in office I saw him chipping away at things that will impact **me.** And I know there are so many Americans that stand to lose way more! But everywhere I look, many Bernie supporters are not seeing that. They're not seeing the hard fought rights that can easily be stripped away. They're not thinking of the vulnerable people that will undoubtedly be hurt.

The virus has made it even clearer to me. So many people are talking about how this is a great time for workers to strike. Are they not understanding that so many people are losing their jobs right now? This will bring us into recession. Millions of people will be out of work, out of money, there's no way a mass strike could get off the ground with so many people desperate for work.

Dare I say the word guys, but it's a big neon sign flashing **privilege.** If I had a dollar for every straight, white, man that told me ""we have nothing to lose! #neverBiden"" I'd have enough money to justify voting red!

My preference for the former over the latter is consistency of record. I recognize, however, that the supporters of each candidate do not necessarily prioritize the same issues. Given that a popular media narrative is that both candidates are ""the same"", I'm interested in responses of Senator Warren's supporters to the following questions.

1. Why did Elizabeth vote for Ronald Reagan? How does she reconcile this with her view that Washington started to get foreign policy wrong ""beginning in the 1980's""? Does this further imply that she supported the invasion of Vietnam?

Opinion: Politics on Reddit is laughable,23,f6mq5k,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/f6mq5k/opinion_politics_on_reddit_is_laughable/,76,1582197737.0,"I posted this on r/conservative but I wanted opinions from here as well.

I want to start off saying I‚Äôm a moderate republican. If you want to discredit what I have to say on that basis alone then you can downvote and just leave. 

Second, I want to say Reddit is an echo chamber for left wing ideology. However, THATS OK! People with similar views and demographics tend to amalgamate. I am not hating on Reddit because it has a strong left bias. If anything, it‚Äôs healthy for people to discuss politics in an open online forum. 

What isn‚Äôt healthy is to completely disregard, hate, and repulse anybody with an opposite view to yours. I find myself here after seeing another ‚ÄúDear ____ Supporters, Why?‚Äù On ask Reddit. At first glance it‚Äôs perfectly fine to ask people why they support a candidate you find unappealing. By hearing another sides argument you can build upon your own political beliefs or alter your beliefs with newfound information. 

(I want to acknowledge other posts that use different language, topics, and motives but I‚Äôm using the above as an example)

But these types of posts don‚Äôt attempt to do any of the above. Rather, it becomes a karma farm for those who provide nothing to the conversation. Almost all the highest rated comments are usually something along the lines ‚Äúbecause I‚Äôm stupid‚Äù, ‚ÄúBecause I hate America‚Äù, ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt understand politics lololol‚Äù, etc. 

Those who do provide real reasons for their support are downvoted into oblivion. Why would you ask for opinions you already don‚Äôt agree with, then downvote them because you disagree? It completely boggles and infuriates me beyond belief. Reddit has become as bad right-wing racist Facebook moms. 

As a final word, I‚Äôm tired of seeing comments in R/politics claiming that people on Reddit (only the ones they agree with btw) are the last citizens fighting for democracy and justice. Stop kidding yourself. Such debates and hissy fits have occurred over the same reasons, over the same types of people, over the same ‚Äúbullshit political system‚Äù, over the past 300 fucking years. 

The only thing you achieve reading the same biased articles, the same biased comments, the same biased opinions, is you become just as partisan as racist Trump voters. Get out and talk to those who have differing views from yourself. Find out why YOU support Sanders, Bloomberg, Biden, Trump, Warren, etc. Don‚Äôt let redditors decide for you.

Maybe I should just stay off R/politics lol

When did we become the party that rejects facts?,0,46i59s,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/46i59s/when_did_we_become_the_party_that_rejects_facts/,8,1455873655.0,"Let's get this out in the open: I'm an unabashed Bernie supporter.  I think his message is on point, his issues positions are ideal, and I believe his presidency will make it far easier for other very progressive candidates to seek higher office.  

That said, I'm writing this not as a Bernie supporter, but as a Democrat.  I've grown increasing frustrated with what I'm seeing from a significant portion of our party: an outright rejection of facts and hard evidence when it comes to the electability of Hillary Clinton.  National polls consistently show that Bernie outperforms her against every Republican opponent.  They also show that Bernie attracts tons of Independent support, while Hillary does not; that Bernie has very high favorability ratings, while Hillary does not; and that Bernie generates high levels of enthusiasm, while Hillary does not.  I understand all the arguments against the polling--we're too far out, Bernie hasn't be subjected to the GOP attack machine, etc.--but that doesn't change my concern.  We are the party of facts.  The polling (and the disparity in fundraising among individual donors) should *at least* give Hillary supporters pause.  And yet, none of it seems to, at least among the most vocal Hillary supporters.  

I'm not saying that Hillary supporters should abandon their preferred candidate.  I'm certainly not saying that Bernie is definitively more electable than Hillary.  I'm saying that Hillary supporters should not just dismiss facts that are inconvenient to their preferred narrative.  It's a shame, and frankly, it's a disgrace to who we are as a party.

Help an Aussie to Understand,1,j1t54d,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/j1t54d/help_an_aussie_to_understand/,12,1601386032.0,"Hey all, Aussie with a thought/questions and looking for some feedback. Before I begin I want to be clear this will be post both here and over at r/Republican assuming moderators from both sides are comfortable with the introspection.

So, whenever one of your political leaders is shown to have done something even their peers find reprehensible (Trump's Ukraine call, Hillary's private email server), the immediate reaction is a whataboutism attacking either the other leader or even just a dubious individual or group from across the aisle. This essentially confirms the disapproval of the favoured leader's actions, otherwise the actions would be plainly defensible outright, no?

This just seems so dopey yet 9/10 its the go-to response, and I know there are smart cookies on both sides. We don't do this to the same degree over here and if anything the party leader is crowned king dipstick and most open to criticism. Your candidates just seem to have ethical rap sheets that could circumnavigate the globe, with any item seeming ripe for disqualification. Both parties have had respectable leaders in the past and most people know somebody in their personal lives they respect - so this is possible. My thinking is that if dems/republicans were more critical of their leaders they might actually build an environment for worthwhile candidates to rise, which might then lead to candidates more palatable to voters across the political spectrum? If ever I had the chance to vote for a respectable candidate of any political leaning that wasn't dripping slime I'd jump at it. Seems like a cut the nose off to spite the face approach to me, or at least spite the other team.

So truly, what's going on here? At first I'd guess it's a compassionate understanding that we all make mistakes, but when it only really applies to one's team captain I'm left stumped.

*Disclaimer: Because it is sure to matter, most of our Aussie politicians from the major parties are spineless centrists so I am not heavily invested in either team. Regardless of the current candidates I don't believe my aligned values of integrity, fortitude and equality are the exclusive property of either US party.*",controversial,democrats

Trump understands politics better than anyone else in our contemporary political world. He understands media and PR better than people running those industries. That is the reason why, no matter how obvious his complete lack of empathy or competence, he keeps winning. 

I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone that Donald J. Trump is clueless about what is being done in the country and what needs to be done. But unfortunately for us, empathy and knowledge don't win you elections, narratives do. And Trump is the master of pushing narratives in his own favor.

Trump and the Republicans are openly poisoning the nation against any new progressive action with fear, they are pushing egregious conspiracy theories relentlessly and it is working. In spite of his disastrous and criminal response to the pandemic, his popularity is growing.

You cannot fight poison with poison. We need to be the antidote. We need to stand with protesters in the street and not call them rioters and looters. We need to focus more on the left because they are as energized, of not more than Trump's base.

It is a big mistake to take this election as a definite win, we have to keep fighting like we are losing by 10.

Joe Kennedy III For US Attorney General?,0,inizbd,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/inizbd/joe_kennedy_iii_for_us_attorney_general/,10,1599412182.0,"Joe Kennedy III is a 39 year old member of the US House who made a poor choice by challenging incumbent Ed Markey for the Democratic nomination for Senate in his home state of Massachusetts and lost the primary.  Since he ran in the primary for Senate, he presumably could not and did simultaneously run in the primary for the US House seat he currently serves in, which means he will be out of a job at the end of the year.

Despite that one poor choice, Kennedy is a smart articulate 39 year old who was a rising star in the Democratic Party right up until this whole Senate fight derailed him.  The Democratic Party needs people about that age to stay involved in politics, build their resumes, hone their craft, do some positive things that get noticed on the national stage, and get ready to be the leaders when the Bidens and the Sanders of the world are no longer with us or retired from politics.

Most of the biggest stars and leaders in the party are quite old, which isn't a bad thing in and of itself, because they all seem quite with it and active, and most are doing a good job, but the simple mechanics of time mean that 10 years from now, people like Biden, Sanders, Pelosi, Schumer, Hoyer, Warren, and others will probably *mostly* be off the national stage or quietly serving in a House or Senate seat but scaling down their schedules and no longer in leadership (I am thinking Warren might be able to run for President again in 2028 if Biden has two solid terms and looks like he was with it and solid the whole time, demonstrating that it can be done for someone about the age she will be, and if Warren ages well, too, speaking purely in terms of political and job-applicable terms.  Even there's the odds are against her, but rather than getting hung up on that, let's just say whether she is or isn't in that position, a lot of space will be open, and that 2028, eight years from now rather than the stated ten years from now premise of the thread, will certainly be the last time she will likely be able to run for President unless she wins and runs for re-election four years later.).

The main younger politician people focus on is AOC, and she is certainly impressive and takes a lot of unwarranted and uncalled for criticism, but she is but one person, and is a polarizing figure who is very much and very strongly associated with one faction of the party.  I'm not saying she couldn't or shouldn't eventually be in Congressional leadership when she's put in the years to merit it, or for that matter, running for President or Vice-President eight years from now, but we still would need more people, and if the Democratic Party remains a defacto alliance of progressives and moderates, some portions of that pool of people will likely need to come from the moderate wing as well as the progressive wing to hold that alliance together.  Another reason that the party needs to develop people from its full ideological range if possible is because we don't know what the political environment will be 10 years from now and need to develop an array of prospects who cover the full range of what attributes a public who's future political characteristics are unknown might be looking for.

Kamala Harris might be in the mix as well, either as President or taking an expanded role in the Senate.

Still, it is to the advantage of the party (Both wings of it) to find Joe Kennedy III a job and a career path that will help him be one of those people in that pool if he's up to it, and it should be a job where he learns something and makes him better than then than he is today's because, hey, everyone has room to learn and improved right? 

Kennedy actually would have been almost a perfect ticket balancer for a progressive Presidential nominee from the south or the west coast this year, but, and I imagine this is part of why he ran for Senate, was not a logical pick for the most likely Presidential nominees who were in the race- the progressives were, like him, from New England, and Joe Biden wasn't likely to pick a younger clone of himself (Not literally a clone, but another white male Roman Catholic moderate Democrat) who would not make the ticket a better reflection of the diversity of the party in some way.

His path to the Senate is probably blocked for at least the next four to eight years, and perhaps beyond that's because it basically would rely on Warren getting elected President.  Markey just beat him and has a fresh term of six years coming up if he wins the general in the fall (Which is likely), and would be tough to either challenge again (Don't make the same mistake twice) or for Kennedy to replace in the event of something happening to him (Kennedy filling a vacancy created by the incumbent he randomly challenged in a primary is bad optics and something that might not go over well with the electorate).

He could potentially run for Governor, but I am not sure that's the sort of thing he's interested (Other than Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the Kennedys have always seemed more interested in participating in national than state government).  He could run for his old House seat in two years, but he might be running against an incumbant Democrat just like this year (Which, again the public may not like and could give him a reputation as not a team player in party politics) and it could be seen as a step back. He could move to a different Congressional, or have his existing home wind up in a different district when the district boundries are adjusted to reflect the results of the 2020 census, but again, potentially seen as a step back, and if it does require he move, that is a whole new issue that some voters may wonder about.

So, I thought, could Biden, if he wins the Presidency (And our country really needs him to- remember to vote) appoint him US Attorney General?  Kennedy would have Kamala Harris as VP to work with him in that scenario, is probably qualified as a former prosecutor, and it'd be something new and different to learn from and add to his resume.

Plus, his grandfather (RFK) was the Attorney General for a while, so it'll help connect him even more with his family's political roots.

What do you all think about that? Would he be a good pick?  I'm sure Sally Yates and others will also be considered and would be equally strong in that role, but I don't see why Kennedy wouldn't be also.

The question this thread was going to be before I had the thought that sparked it's title was going to be ""What's next for Joe Kennedy III?"", so if you have other ideas, or even better have actually heard something about what his gameplan is, I'd be interested.  What other cabinet positions would be a good fit? Should he run for Governor afrer all?  I tend to think stuff like DNC chair winds up hurting a little more than it helps in terms of transitioning back to running for office, on average, but I suppose that could be an option.

Massachusetts is in some ways a good state to be a Democratic politician in- Democrats usually win there (The occasional moderate Republican Governor aside), but it can also be tough in that a lot of the best jobs are already taken by people who have survived the wars and can beat back a challenge.

I don't know, I'd like to think the party can set him up with something or he can figure out how own path to stay involved, and that we as a party and a nation won't lose out on him based on one bad choice he made that wasn't even a scandal, just a political miscalculation.",controversial,democrats

This is our most sacred promise to the world.

# We all knew Barack Obama would be anything but a typical president, and so did he know that Joe Biden would be anything but a typical vice president.

Barack Obama, a man who has shown a lifetime of stellar judgment, did not pick Joe as a ploy to increase his performance among white voters‚Äîif that was his intent, quite frankly, he would have instead chosen from among any of the numerous other white male politicians who could have boasted a constituency larger than a career Senator from Delaware.

No, he picked Joe because he knew he would need an experienced and reliable partner to navigate the immense challenges of our nation‚Äôs highest office. Joe Biden was more than just a helpful teammate. He and Barack became best friends in public and in private. A good leader sets the example, and doesn‚Äôt need to brag about his achievements and constantly inflate his own perception of himself.

As their years together went by, the strength of Joe‚Äôs character shone through so brightly to our 44th president‚Äîa man of immeasurable brilliance himself‚Äîthat he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom, With Distinction, the highest civilian award the President of the United States can bestow. What the award's clinically specific definition represents is perhaps better conveyed in one word: Hero.

>*What the Presidential Medal of Freedom is awarded for, in official terminology, is ‚Äúan especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.‚Äù*

# President Obama recognized Joe Biden‚Äôs personal integrity and sacrifice in service of our country, and challenged all good men to measure up to his moral character.

President Obama has repeatedly commented that selecting Joe as his vice president was the best decision he ever made, and has given his full and unequivocal endorsement of his former subordinate to dutifully serve our country in his old office.

In that pivotal moment that our country most needed it, Barack Obama rose to an impossible challenge and shared with us his vision of what the United States could become if we allowed ourselves to be guided by our shared hopes and ideals instead of our personal fears and insecurities. He united an entire generation of young Americans by inspiring them to pursue their common purpose in a way no Chief Executive of this vast, incredibly diverse nation had been able to do before.

President Obama chose to endorse Joe Biden in the exact way that he did in order to send a very clear message to all who understand and cherish what it truly means to be an American, regardless of what lives we were born into, or what decade our family first arrived. He reached out to all of us with this message, and my generation heard it in our hearts as clear as day.

>*As I was born in the 1980's, I am clearly considered a Millennial. A man of unparalleled greatness became our Commander-in-Chief by earning an incredible two-thirds of my generation‚Äôs votes, and he accomplished this during a time of unprecedented national crisis and intractable political division ‚Äî not entirely unlike what lies before us once again.*

It has become a tragic hallmark of my generation to have witnessed that so quickly after a brilliant man stood up to inspire us to dream of who we could become, legions of vengeful and angry men stood up to remind us who we still were.

When we watched the man with the strongest, purest moral character we had ever known in our short Millennial lives serve his final day in office, we had no idea of the depth of carnage in store for us at the hands of his abhorrent successor.

Barack Obama's shining moral character unified us in the wake of the last global catastrophe that threatened to snuff out humanity's hope for a better world in our lifetimes. And yet, in that moment we began to feel something that many other Americans may be only now beginning to realize as well--that the unifying strength of Joe Biden's moral character is exactly what we need now that darkness has fallen upon us once again.

# Down to his very soul, Joe Biden is absolutely everything that Donald Trump is not.

* Joe Biden is honest.  
^(Donald Trump is pathologically fraudulent.)
* Joe Biden is compassionate and merciful.  
^(Donald Trump is a spewing volcano of hate.)
* Joe Biden is driven by kindness and respect.  
^(Donald Trump is driven by malice and spite.)
* Joe Biden is a humble companion.  
^(Donald Trump is an insufferable braggart.)
* Joe Biden is sometimes amusingly impetuous.  
^(Donald Trump is constantly vulgar and profane.)
* Joe Biden respects disagreements made in good faith.  
^(Donald Trump respects only fawning obedience.)
* Joe Biden is a fearless public servant.  
^(Donald Trump is an irredeemable coward.)
* Joe Biden is known to be respectful and introspective.  
^(Donald Trump is known to be predatory and unrepentant.)

>*While drifting down that list, did you notice how instantly and clearly you felt the truth of each statement, despite no actual references to any specific historical events?*

# You don‚Äôt have to be a Democrat, Republican, liberal, or conservative to know in your heart exactly what kind of man Joe Biden is.

Joe Biden demonstrates the true quality of his moral character every day of his life, whether anyone is watching or not. There is no one on this earth more suited to help us begin healing the toxic corrosion in our society caused by the Trump era than the man who stands for us as the polar opposite of everything Donald Trump represents. He is the humanity within Americans that Donald Trump cannot destroy.

The strength of our nation‚Äôs moral character lives eternally in the souls of all good people, and that's why I support Joe Biden.",controversial,democrats

===========  
The term originates in the systematic psychological manipulation of a victim by her husband in Patrick Hamilton‚Äôs 1938 stage play Gas Light, and the film adaptations released in 1940 and 1944. In the story, the husband attempts to convince his wife and others that she is insane by manipulating small elements of their environment and insisting that she is mistaken, remembering things incorrectly, or delusional when she points out these changes. The play's title alludes to how the abusive husband slowly dims the gas lights in their home, while pretending nothing has changed, in an effort to make his wife doubt her own perceptions. The wife repeatedly asks her husband to confirm her perceptions about the dimming lights, but in defiance of reality, he keeps insisting that the lights are the same and instead it is she who is going insane.  


We are living in a perpetual state of gaslighting. The reality that we are being told by the media is at complete odds with what we are seeing with our own two eyes. And when we question the false reality that we are being presented, or we claim that what we see is that actual reality, we are vilified as racist or bigots or just plain crazy. You‚Äôre not racist. You‚Äôre not crazy. You‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


New York State has twice as many deaths from Covid-19 than any other state, and New York has accounted for one fifth of all Covid-19 deaths, but we are told that New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has handled the pandemic better than any other governor. But if we support policies of Governors whose states had only a fraction of the infections and deaths as New York, we‚Äôre called anti-science and want people to die. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


We see mobs of people looting stores, smashing windows, setting cars on fire and burning down buildings, but we are told that these demonstrations are peaceful protests. And when we call this destruction of our cities, riots, we are called racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


We see the major problem destroying many inner-cities is crime; murder, gang violence, drug dealing, drive-by shootings, armed robbery, but we are told that it is not crime, but the police that are the problem in the inner-cities. We are told we must defund the police and remove law enforcement from crime-riddled cities to make them safer. But if we advocate for more policing in cities overrun by crime, we are accused of being white supremacists and racists. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


The United States of America accepts more immigrants than any other country in the world. The vast majority of the immigrants are ‚Äúpeople of color‚Äù, and these immigrants are enjoying freedom and economic opportunity not available to them in their country of origin, but we are told that the United States is the most racist and oppressive country on the planet, and if we disagree, we are called racist and xenophobic. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


Capitalist countries are the most prosperous countries in the world The standard of living is the highest in capitalist countries. We see more poor people move up the economic ladder to the middle and even the wealthy class through their effort and ability in capitalist countries than any other economic system in the world, but we are told capitalism is an oppressive system designed to keep people down. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


Communist countries killed over 100 million people in the 20th century. Communist countries strip their citizens of basic human rights, dictate every aspect of their lives, treat their citizens like slaves, and drive their economies into the ground, but we are told that Communism is the fairest, most equitable, freest and most prosperous economic system in the world. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


The most egregious example of gaslighting is the concept of ‚Äúwhite fragility‚Äù. You spend your life trying to be a good person, trying to treat people fairly and with respect. You disavow racism and bigotry in all its forms. You judge people solely on the content of their character and not by the color of their skin. You don‚Äôt discriminate based on race or ethnicity. But you are told you are a racist, not because of something you did or said, but solely because of the color of your skin. You know instinctively that charging someone with racism because of their skin color is itself racist. You know that you are not racist, so you defend yourself and your character, but you are told that your defense of yourself is proof of your racism. So, we ask ourselves, am I crazy? No, you‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


Gaslighting has become one of the most pervasive and destructive tactics in American politics. It is the exact opposite of what our political system was meant to be. It deals in lies and psychological coercion, and not the truth and intellectual discourse. If you ever ask yourself if you‚Äôre crazy, you are not. Crazy people aren‚Äôt sane enough to ask themselves if they‚Äôre crazy. So, trust yourself, believe what‚Äôs in your heart. Trust your eyes over what you are told. Never listen to the people who tell you that you are crazy, because you are not, you‚Äôre being gaslighted.  


Sophocles said: ""What people believe prevails over the truth.""  


And that's what the media are trying to exploit.

"Today on Senator McCain's funeral,only one living president is not invited : Donald Trump. Till this day he didn't apologize to McCain's family or the POWs for trashing all those members in uniform who were captured and tortured by our enemies.",983,9c2tsl,https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/9c2tsl/today_on_senator_mccains_funeralonly_one_living/,27,1535835251.0,"In an Op-Ed in today's NYT ""Straining to Keep Faith with America"" Bret Stephens has trashed Trump in no uncertain terms by adding this in his piece ""John McCain knew that we are better than Trump.""

To that I like to add my own thoughts saying that maybe, I emphasize the word ""maybe"" again to say that maybe a healthy Senator McCain could put a stop to a marauding president called Trump. 

But with the Republican Senator John McCain's death, there is nothing that can stop Trump from destroying each and every American values that this country developed over two centuries plus more.

Even a Republican president Ronald Reagan's description of America was much different from Trump's vision.

By quoting a phrase from Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Reagan declared that our country is like ""a shining city on a hill"".

But since Trump took over the presidency, every Americans are ""straining to keep Faith with America"", the country they love dearly unlike Trump and his followers who only think of what they can get. 

Even Democratic president John Kennedy's words on his inauguration on January 20th, 1961, ""Ask not what your country can do for you_ask what can do for your country"", have no sway over the minds of these fake ""swamp cleaners"" like Trump. 

Trump is more interested in finding how much money he can milk from his presidency than giving some of his assets to the countrymen who were really struggling everyday to keep their faith on America.

Their struggles to keep faith on our institutions are four hundred times more now than before Trump took office on Jan 20th, '17.

That is the reason why we've to feel sorry for John McCain's permanent absence from an institution, mainly the Senate where he grilled each and every Trump's appointees and his cabinet members to hit hard at Trump's illogical policies.

Trump on the other hand didn't have the decency to go to McCain before his death or to his wife and families now to apologize saying, ""I should've never said that I don't care for people like you who got captured at war. As you know I didn't go to Vietnam for my bad foot. But I really appreciate your pains and sufferings due to terrible tortures at the hands of the Vietcong guerrillas. I'm really sorry that you endured those tortures for five plus years just to keep our country safe. May God bless your soul.""

Am I really dreaming that Trump would say those kind words and apologize to John McCain or his wife Cindy or his children or to all our POWs ?  Not in a million years ! No way .",top,democrats
